      "about" : "With End Game, Damien Hirst confronts us with the fact that we are mortal. At once repellent and beautiful, the sculpture focuses on two human skeletons, male and female. Flanking the skeletons are two cases containing an array of the kind of medical equipment commonly used in an operating theater or morgue. Although the implements seem to be found objects, they were commissioned by the artist, fabricated to his exact specifications and engraved with his last name.\r\n\r\n\tFor Hirst, the surgical instruments represent both the miracle and horror of modern medicine. The title End Game refers to the final stage of a chess match. Endgame is also the name of a Samuel Beckett play in which four characters face the inevitability of their demise. Rooted in the history of art, End Game specifically addresses the idea of vanitas. Latin for vanity, the word describes a type of painting common in Northern Europe during the 17th century. These still-life compositions represent the fleeting nature of existence, using symbols like hourglasses, rotting fruit and flowers, and\u2014most notably\u2014skulls. End Game reinvents the conventions of the vanitas picture for modern times, insisting that viewers recognize the fragility of life and their own reluctance to acknowledge death.",

The artist was probably asked to paint a storm, and he approached the task with ferocious energy. \r\n\r\n\tCourbet displays his entire range of technical brilliance as well as his intense personal emotion in this vivid landscape. Dark clouds loom over a panoramic view of windswept oaks that lead the eye from the craggy rock formations and pool of the foreground to the still-sunlit mountain range in the far distance. Whereas the mountains are painted with small, delicate brushstrokes, Courbet made use of the palette knife as well as the brush to create the vibrant effects of the foreground. The rocks take on a sculptural, almost three-dimensional quality thanks to the thick buildup of paint with the knife; by contrast, the tree trunks and branches are created with oily drags of a soft brush, and the leaves are rendered through vague stipple marks.\r\n\r\n\tThe landscape is probably a site in the Forest of Fontainebleau, a vast expanse of virtually untouched forest a short distance from Paris. Courbet's inclusion of the mountain range, which does not exist in proximity to the forest, transforms this very realistic setting into a type of fantasy.",

      "about" : "Arriving in Paris from Romania in 1904, Constantin Brancusi found inspiration in ancient Cycladic sculptures and African art. His goal in sculpture was to reveal the essence of a subject rather than its exterior form. To achieve this objective, Brancusi abandoned the academic method of modeling in clay and instead carved directly from stone.\r\n\r\n\tBrancusi believed in basic forms as a path to truth. His disregard for anatomical detail and his celebration of elemental shapes are exemplified in A Muse. He first carved a marble version of A Muse in 1912. Revisiting the form in 1917, the artist did not simply make an identical copy; rather, he elongated the bust and arm and modified the facial features for greater simplicity. In A Muse, Brancusi explores the classical form of ideal female beauty, rendered in the simplified shapes of Cycladic art. This version in highly polished bronze displays a hard, streamlined beauty forecasting the machine aesthetics of modern art.",

      "about" : "Paul Cézanne produced more than 40 painted portraits of his wife, Hortense Fiquet, during their roughly three decades together. In the MFAH version, Hortense is striking in her plainness. Cézanne makes no attempt to probe her personality or emotional state. Rather, his primary interest is in the relationship of forms.\r\n\r\n\tIn Madame Cézanne in Blue, he creates subtle tensions between Hortense's body and the space that surrounds her. For example, the brown shapes in the background merge with her body in an undefined, mysterious manner, making the space behind her right side difficult to read. Also, the right side of her face is presented as a mask-like form, a cutout on top of the background. Cézanne's treatment of the left side of her body is completely different. Through contrasts of light and shade set against a light-filled background, he defines the space more clearly.\r\n\r\n\tCézanne's work exerted a profound influence on modern painting. First trained in his native Aix-en-Provence, Cézanne went in 1861 to Paris, where he studied at the informal Académie Suisse and met Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro, who influenced Cézanne's artistic development. Cézanne sought\u2014in contrast to his Impressionist contemporaries\u2014a classicizing, less-naturalistic mode of expression, and he attempted to realize in his canvases the sensations of light and color that he saw in nature. In his maturity he came to harmonize two seemingly antagonistic styles; he imposed Impressionist free brushwork and the high-keyed color of natural light on compositions in which individual elements, including the human form, were reordered and even distorted.",

Surrealist writers and painters were fascinated by the possibilities of automatic drawing, a method of free association that allowed the artist to tap into the creative unconscious. Miró described his series of circus images as dream paintings, and the openness of their compositions is in part related to his deepening connection with the Surrealists.",

Picasso highlights the differences between the two figures by painting them in quite different styles. One can identify the figure on the left as a hard, angular woman (perhaps Picasso\u2019s wife, Olga), and the one on the right as a more sensuous woman (Marie-Thérèse Walter, his lover at the time). Whereas the left figure is sharp and concrete, the right figure is inviting, delicate, and ghost-like, appearing as if in a dream.",

      "about" : "The revolution wrought upon the art of sculpture at the turn of the 14th century in France by a number of Netherlandish sculptors, headed by Claus Sluter and his assistant Claus de Werve, can be appreciated in the exceptionally rare ivory figure God the Father. The brilliant carving suggests that this work must have been an important commission despite its diminutive size. The abundant, spilling folds of drapery that intensify the feeling of volume and weight in the figure, the fleeting quality conveyed by his stance and hand gesture, and the realistically expressive facial features suggest a direct connection with the art of Sluter.\r\n\r\n\tThis small sculpture was once part of a group depicting the Christian Trinity: God the Father mostly likely held in his outstretched hand a cross supporting the body of the crucified Christ, and the Holy Spirit was represented by a dove. God the Father reflects the elegance and sophistication of the International Style that arose about 1400 and was characterized by a love of calligraphic outline and curvilinear patterns and marked a tendency toward realistic detail. Originating in the wake of social change that enabled not only princes and dukes but also the lesser nobility to become patrons of the arts, the International Style catered to aristocratic tastes throughout western Europe.",

Le Corbusier, who was fascinated by machines, referred to this design as a \u201cmachine for resting.\u201d Indeed, with its adjustable frame, the chair offers numerous positions for relaxing.\r\n\r\n\tIn the late 1920s, avant-garde French furniture design was heavily influenced by the innovations emanating from the Bauhaus design movement in Germany. The tubular steel designs of Marcel Breuer, in particular, spurred many French designers, including Le Corbusier, to develop their own furniture featuring these new materials and innovative style. The manufacturer Thonet began producing this Chaise Longue, which is model number 2072, in Austria in 1929, soon after the chair was first designed. Embru-Werke, the manufacturer of the MFAH example, took over production briefly from 1933 to 1937 and later, under license from Thonet, the firm once again produced the chaise in the 1950s. The Italian furniture maker Cassina began production in 1965 and Chaise Longue 2072 has been one of the company's most popular models ever since.",

      "about" : "Florence (\"Flossie\") Pierce was the daughter of a lighthouse keeper who lived on an island off the coast of Maine, where artist George Bellows spent several summers. In this portrait of her, Bellows experiments with bold color arranged in large blocks. At the same time, he suggests a complex psychological presence conveyed by the brightly lit gaze of his subject.\r\nBellows was associated with the Ashcan School, a group of painters in New York City who celebrated everyday subject matter in paintings of the urban scene. His energetic style and broad brushwork won immediate praise and recognition, and at the age of 27, he was elected as one of the youngest associates in the history of the National Academy of Design. Four years later, in 1913, he became an academician and exhibited in New York's landmark Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art). His exposure there to modern European art is evident in the heightened color, and concern for form and structure, seen in Portrait of Florence Pierce. The dramatic lighting and loose paint handling, especially beautiful in the sitter\u2019s foreshortened arm and hand draped over the chair back, are characteristic of the powerful, realistic portraits that Bellows painted throughout his career.",

Vouet was one of the most successful foreign painters in Italy, and he continued to enjoy a prestigious and influential career after his return to France. Vouet's Saint Sebastian shows the impact of the work of Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (known as Caravaggio), whose compositions often were limited to one figure or a few figures, shown in half length, set in obscure surroundings, and illuminated by a strong, raking light.",

Typical of the vibrantly colorful style of fauves, French for \"wild beasts,\" the canvas glows with intense colors. Flame-colored trees burn red, orange, and blue. Yellow, the color of sunlight, is everywhere.\r\n\r\n\tThis monumental landscape represents the French village of L\u2019Estaque, where Paul Cézanne had painted earlier. The painting's title comes from the road that curves through the scene from the lower right. Derain made his way to southern France in 1905, joining Henri Matisse in developing the essential aspects of a new style together. Their freedom from the constraints of expressing the objective world is celebrated in this image. It is a fantasy in color, a place where reality is overrun by the decorative impulse. The Turning Road, L\u2019Estaque serves as a milestone in the brief, yet crucial art-historical movement of Fauvism, which explored the central tenet of Modernist painting: that the strength of a picture has more to do with colors and the kinds of marks made on the surface of the canvas than with serving as a window on the world.",

On the latter trip he began to draw up a list of cities that would become the titles of the Protractor series. Stella limited the series to three patterns of decoration found in Islamic art: interlaces, rainbows, and fans. At the same time, he reduced these patterns to their essential, boldest forms, increasing the scale of his work so that his paintings assumed the physical proportions of architecture.\r\n\r\n\tDamascus Gate highlights a decisive moment in the artist\u2019s ongoing project to test the limits of painting. Stretching across a 50-foot expanse, it fulfilled the artist\u2019s ambition to take his work up to a truly monumental scale.

He sprang to fame with Fishermen at Sea, a 1796 work showing the influence of 17th-century Dutch marine painting. Over the next 15 years, he gradually developed a mastery, unrivaled in the history of art, of rendering the sea in all its motions and under every condition of light and weather. Sheerness as Seen from the Nore, exhibited at Turner\u2019s own gallery in 1808, stands near the end of a decade of powerful and inventive marine paintings and is one of the masterpieces of his early period.",

Driven by more than aesthetics, de Stijl aimed to unite the material and spiritual worlds through an art of pure geometry.\r\n\r\n\tFor Mondrian, a grid-pattern composition of horizontal and vertical lines could represent the universal harmony of the world. He saw the grid as a resolution to the opposing demands of the material and spiritual. Although Composition with Grid 1, 1918 appears to be a random sequence of squares and rectangles, X-ray photography has revealed that Mondrian first sketched a perfectly uniform grid of rectangles based on the classical golden section. This underlying grid then formed the scaffolding for the superimposed composition, giving the work an exceptional harmony of proportion. A nuance of mood and tone is established through the variations in gray and ochre glazes so that the ultimate effect is one of subtly shifting planes of color.",

A symbolic overtone suggests that the enjoyments of life were interrupted, perhaps by death, or forsaken for higher ideals.\r\n\r\n\tThis still life demonstrates one of Heda\u2019s specialties. After beginning his career as a figure painter, Heda soon became the leading representative of Dutch still-life painting. He created a genre that he brought to perfection by repeating his compositions, changing only slightly from one to another the arrangement of objects he had chosen to depict. Here, he juxtaposes glassware, silver vessels, and oyster shells on a white tablecloth. Their monochromatic harmony is subtly countered by the pink ham, light-blue decoration of the Delft bowl, and acid-yellow rind of the half-peeled lemon.\r\n\r\n\tHeda\u2019s self-contained painting expresses simultaneously an appetite for worldly goods, so lusciously depicted, and a desire for intellectual rigor, conveyed through an economy of color. Only the light falling through unseen windows, barely reflected in glass and silver and caressing the linen tablecloth and oyster flesh, alludes to a world outside this quiet interior.",

Like artists Rembrandt van Rijn and Käthe Kollwitz, Munch made self-portraits in various media throughout his life, recording his psychic state at different periods. This representation is an especially chilling example.\r\n\r\n\tEmerging from the darkness, Munch\u2019s disembodied head--a common motif in late-19th-century Symbolist art--floats in a velvety black ether. His forearm and hand, symbols of his artistic creativity, lie across the lower edge. At the top, balancing the arm, is a white band in which Munch inscribed his name and the date, 1895. Thus configured, the image resembles a tombstone and evokes the timeless motif of memento mori (reminder of mortality or death), as well as the image of Christ on the Sudarium of Oviedo, believed to be the burial face cloth of Jesus.\r\n\r\n\tSeveral features indicate that this print is a very early impression. The artist used an olive-green paper, which enhances the image\u2019s psychological effect, for proof impressions. The edition was printed on white or gray papers. In addition, the striations in the background disappeared in later impressions as the ink puddled on the stone.",

Rejecting the representation of three-dimensional forms through traditional one-point perspective, they instead represented their subjects through a system of flat signs.\r\n\r\n\tThe Rower belongs to the period of Analytic Cubism, as seen in the painting's limited palette of brown, gray, and black, and its nearly unrecognizable subject. The figure\u2014defined by complex horizontal layering\u2014emerges from an undefined background. The oval head, rectangular neck, and sharp angles of elbows are identifiable, even as the arrangement of shapes suggests abstract volumes in space.",

The tiny plaque displays the sophistication of ivory carving during the middle period of imperial Byzantium (330\u20131453). Its disciplined style results from an adherence to dominant court workshop traditions in 10th-century Constantinople. Evident in this plaque is the Byzantine tendency to enhance the spiritual value of a religious representation by abstracting the forms and establishing a hierarchy among the figures. It also demonstrates strong classical elements, the virtues of which Byzantine artists discovered anew during the late 9th century and with which the Byzantine style is infused. The plaque is from a portable diptych or possibly a triptych representing major Greek Orthodox feasts.",

Thomas Chippendale, the firm of Mayhew and Ince, and Thomas Johnson were among the most prominent. Johnson, in particular, was known for his elaborate furniture designs featuring exaggerated asymmetrical curves, animals, figures, and trailing branches, all executed in the high Rococo style. TorchËres were used to hold candelabra or decorative porcelain objects. This pair was inspired by Johnson's designs.",

Courtauld was brought to England as an infant, was apprenticed to the distinguished Huguenot silversmith Simon Pantin in 1701, and went on to establish a dynasty of talented London silversmiths. Courtauld raised the body of the basket from a single piece of silver, then pierced the rim and bowl with patterns of crosses and swirls. The grapevine border, paw feet, and handle were cast separately and then applied. An engraver added the owner\u2019s coat of arms to the inside of the bowl. The end result is a sophisticated, yet playful, addition to an English tea table.",

      "about" : "In the early 1950s, Franz Kline began paring down his paintings, purging them of all color and representational references. Wotan is one of his most austere compositions, focused simply on the stark contrast between his black brushstrokes and their white background. Kline insisted that all areas of his canvases were equal in weight: \u201cI paint the white as well as the black, and the white is just as important.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tThis iconic image records the power of the artist's vision and the authority of his gesture. The title, Wotan, refers to a Germanic deity of the pre-Christian era. A king of the gods, Wotan could also assume the role of wanderer, seer, and poet. Additionally, Wotan was a central character in Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle operas, which Kline often listened to in the art studio. For Kline, the title is not intended to describe the character of his painting; rather, by summoning up a mythic past, Kline claims a similar timelessness for his bold and revolutionary work.",

Gallé explored widely ranging techniques that included historical methods such as cameo cutting, acid etching, engraving, enameling, and mold blowing, as well as novel experiments with powdered colors, metallic foils, and inlay. To create Water Lily Vase, Gallé manipulated layers of glass. An inner, pale green underlayer was encased in red glass that was then carved away in a cameo technique to reveal the green underneath.",

In the 18th century, Giles and his atelier were commissioned to decorate white porcelain for the Worcester factory. The distinctive work of Giles´s studio can be seen in the elaborate gilt and claret border, and beautifully rendered cut fruit and lush flowers.\r\n\r\n\tFrom 1767 to 1771, Giles had an agreement with Worcester that supplied him with white porcelain to decorate. Giles worked in the most current and fashionable styles and was particularly known for his fruit, flower, and bird painting. His wares are recognized for the high quality of their painting and gilding. The pairing of fruit and flower elements seen here is often referred to as the Hope-Edwardes pattern, after Sir Thomas Edwardes, for whom a service of this type was first made.",

Beginning in the early 1400s, mustard could be produced locally rather than being imported, and it became one of the least expensive and most widely available spices. Worcester and other porcelain factories responded by making mustard pots. This pot features asymmetrically scrolling vines and flowers rendered in a Chinese color palette called famille rose, and the lid is decorated with a flying stork, the Chinese symbol of longevity.",

Although Venetian women were legendary for their beauty, portraits of them were relatively rare during the Renaissance. Only 11 out of approximately 400 existing portraits by Veronese depict females. At the time, the possession and public display of luxury items\u2014indicators of power and identity\u2014were regulated by rules called sumptuary laws. But there was no penalty for being depicted in opulent attire, and portraiture was a way to establish status. Veronese excelled at rendering these external symbols, and Portrait of a Woman as Saint Agnes reveals his opulent style, as seen in the elaborate brocade, rich coloring, and gold embroidered dress.",

Particularly popular were his paintings that featured nude women in subjects from Roman mythology and classical history.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Suicide of Lucretia depicts the virtuous wife of a Roman nobleman.\r\n\tThe morning after she was raped by the king's son, she told her father\r\n\tand husband what had happened, and then she fatally stabbed herself.\r\n\tHer suicide enraged the people of Rome, who expelled the ruling family, laying the foundation for the establishment of a republic.

And while there is a consistency across the series in terms of technology and form, Laarman created each design out of different materials, thereby continuing to push the boundary of possibilities in form.\r\n\r\n\tIn 2004, Laarman saw a documentary on a software program that General Motors had adapted to create optimized car parts. The program simulated the manner in which human bones grew; in particular, the natural way that the human body produces more bone in areas where it is required for strength and less in areas where it is not. Laarman became fascinated by the way that industry had adapted this natural occurrence and sought to design a chair using the same principle. He contacted General Motors to seek permission to use the software, and the Bone chair was born.\r\n\r\n\tAlthough the software precisely calculates the thickness of each branch and curve of his chair designs, Laarman actually directs the process. \u201cI didn\u2019t use it [the program] to create the world\u2019s next perfect chair,\" he said, \"but as a high-tech sculpting tool to create elegant shapes with a kind of legitimacy.\u201d",

      "about" : "Gaetano Pesce designed the prototype for the Pratt Chair series while was teaching at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. In these forms, Pesce explores ideas of craft and mass production, structure, and the human body. The chairs are made on commission in Pesce\u2019s studio: Each chair is unique, owing to way the worker pours the colored resins into the mold, and the setting of the material. The Pratt chairs were made in nine models, ranging from structureless to uncomfortably rigid. The variation in weight-bearing structure is achieved by varying the density of the polyurethane.\r\n\r\n\tThis prototype is the first original mold for the series. Handmade by Pesce, the chair was then reproduced in sculpted plaster, from which the final form was cast in resin. The prototype is noticeably thicker than the production models, whose resin \u201cskin\u201d is flexible and appears stretched. It has a matte, opaque surface with little to no translucency, as opposed to the complete translucency of the production chair. The prototype also highlights the development of the decorative vocabulary of the Pratt chairs\u2014only the handprint on the back rail and texturing on the seat are visible. Other motifs that later were part of the production models are not yet seen.",

The effects of light highlight the \u201cangel,\u201d whose outline or presence is imbued in the glass.\r\n\r\n\tThe monumental sculpture stands almost 8 feet high and is comprised of three separate tapered forms that stack upon one another. Each section is cast, weighs approximately 300 pounds, and needed to be an exact series of angles and measurements in order for the sculpture to be stable and uniform. The surface and edges of each section of the sculpture are textured, which\u2014along with the optical effects\u2014provides a constant and changing source of pattern. Space is defined by the edges of each plane, creating a narrow void within the minimal form. When lit, varying thicknesses of glass throughout the sculpture, along with the central void, provide a changing landscape of transparency, translucency, and opacity.",

The first of these tasks was to slay a lion that terrorized the citizens of Nemea. The animal was invulnerable to Hercules's weapons, so he strangled it to death.

One of the important sources for American furniture in that style was a design book published in 1754 by Thomas Chippendale.\r\n\r\n\tTogether with its mate in the Pendleton Collection at the Rhode Island School of Design, this slab table must have made an impressive ensemble in 18th-century Philadelphia. The tables were probably commissioned for a principal parlor, or perhaps for adjoining rooms where their placement produced a mirrored symmetry. That they were conceived as a pair is evidenced by the subtle yet complementary variations on the two pieces. For example, on this frame the carved leaves trailing down the legs curl outward, and on the Pendleton table they turn inward. The central ruffles carved on the skirts, although identical in execution, also display a paired orientation, maintaining an asymmetry consistent with Rococo dictates. Made of mahogany and topped with a marble slab, this table was the most costly of its kind.",

Serving tea was a sign of politeness and hospitality, and drinking it was a custom of distinctive manners and specific equipment, such as teapots, teacups and saucers, teaspoons, and tea canisters. A sampling of 18th-century Boston inventories reveals that in some households all or part of the tea equipage was prominently displayed on the tea table, such as this one, rather than being stored in cupboards.",

The \"Zig Zag\" is one of the most important experimental chair designs of its time.\r\n\r\n\tRietveld intended the chair to be mass-produced from simple materials. It consists of four rectangles whose arrangement forms a cohesive unit that gives the appearance of seamless construction in profile. At first, however, Rietveld was unable to achieve a continuous cantilevered structure that would hold the weight of a person solely in wood. Therefore, he inserted a series of screws, dovetail joints, and reinforcing wedges to structurally support the design. The \"Zig Zag\" Chair  was ultimately produced by the Dutch firm Metz &amp; Co. in a few variations until the 1950s. Because of its iconic status, in 1971, the chair was again put into production by the Italian firm Cassina. This example in pine dates from the earliest years.",

In order to heighten the empathy between viewer and image, artists commonly depicted saints in a more direct and intimate format, eliminating complex attributes of iconography.\r\n\t\r\n\tJames the Greater, one of the 12 apostles and brother of John the Evangelist, was among the circle of men closest to Christ. James was present with Peter and John at the Transfiguration and again at the Agony in the Garden, when Jesus retired to the Mount of Olives to pray just before His arrest.

In this painting, the identification of Artemesia as a Sibyl\u2014defined in ancient Greek literature and legend as a woman with the gift of prophecy\u2014may be based on what happened during the trial of Roman artist Agostino Tassi, whom she accused of rape. She voluntarily submitted to a torture called the sibyls, which involved a device consisting of metal rings that were tightened about the fingers by a set of cords to determine the truth.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe view of the sibyl and her upturned head are typical features of Orazio Gentileschi's heroines, and the rendering of her sumptuous orange brocade drapery anticipates the increased elegance of his later painting. His precociously gifted daughter possessed a formidable personality, and she became not only one of the greatest of Caravaggesque painters but also a heroine to feminist art historians.",

The painting contains all the basic elements of the modern style. The sundrenched scene, with the almost palpable summer heat radiating off the garden path, was most likely painted out\r\n\tof doors according to the Impressionist canon. The short, sketchy brush-strokes employed by Caillebotte embody his desire to capture a fleeting moment\u2014that instant before the light changes and the feeling of delicious quiet and repose could be disrupted.\r\n\t\r\n\tYet even these Impressionist aspects do not account fully for the striking nature of The Orange Trees. Inspired by photography, Japanese prints, and the aesthetics of Baron Haussmann's newly constructed boulevards and uniform apartment buildings of modern Paris, Caillebotte explored a new way of seeing and transposing that vision onto a two-dimensional plane.",

Claude Monet himself said, \"There is only one master here: Corot.\" \r\n\t\r\n\tIn this painting, the fabled musician Orpheus--who beguiled the Greek gods to allow him to retrieve his beloved wife, who had been fatally bitten by a snake--leads her tenderly from the underworld. In ancient times, it was believed that the deceased continued to exist as spirits, seen here gathered in small groups beneath the delicate trees. Corot, a great music lover, has imbued this work with a sense of melancholy lyricism that hints at the tragic end of the story: Orpheus loses Eurydice forever when he turns to look at her before reaching the world of the living.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe sense of filtered reality is enhanced by Corot's extraordinarily subtle\r\n\tuse of color. He strikes a wistfully sweet tonal chord, carefully modulating\r\n\ta narrow range of grays, greens, and blues. Orpheus Leading Eurydice\r\n\tfrom the Underworld looks forward to the artist's signature paintings, the Souvenirs and Memoires, in which Corot removes all narrative elements and lets his landscapes stand as \"pure\" objects.",

The juxtaposition of textured and flat surfaces, and matte and glossy passages, imparts a great liveliness to the surface, creating a perfect counterbalance to the dark tones of the painting.\r\n\r\n\tThis work is the only painting and final piece in a series of more than 40 drawings Gorky produced from 1930 to 1934. The first sketches of the series were based on Paolo Uccello\u2019s 15th-century panel The Profanation of the Host, echoing its fractured space and exaggerated perspective. As the series progressed, Gorky turned his attention to more concrete details, and in particular he chose to isolate and elaborate upon the biomorphic forms that dominated the left half of his drawings. This shift introduced a new and concentrated note of psychological intensity into Gorky\u2019s work.\r\n\r\n\tNighttime, Enigma and Nostalgia is a summation painting, the definitive statement of all of Gorky's influences and concerns in the early 1930s. Cubism and Surrealism, as well as the artist\u2019s wide knowledge of the history of art, are brilliantly assimilated into the work. His masterly handling of the different degrees of black, along with the poetic sobriety of the balanced forms, reflects Gorky\u2019s interest in Spanish painting. The evidence of his hard work\u2014scraping down and repainting\u2014abounds in this example, testifying to the importance that Gorky assigned to it. In 1941, when asked to describe the subject of Nighttime, Enigma and Nostalgia, Gorky replied: \u201cWounded birds, poverty, and one whole week of rain.\u201d",

      "about" : "The many variations of Claude Monet's Water Lilies are probably some of the most beloved works of the 20th century. Millions of people have made the pilgrimage to France to visit Monet's house in Giverny, where the gardens served as inspiration for hundreds of the artist's paintings. Monet purchased the house in 1890 and greatly expanded the water-lily pond at the bottom of the garden.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe MFAH version of Water Lilies, or Nymphéas in French, was part of a first concentrated campaign by Monet to capture the delicate blooms at different times of the day, under different atmospheric conditions. When, after much hesitation, he exhibited a suite of 48 water-lily paintings in 1909 at the Paris gallery of his art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, the series became an enormous financial, popular, and critical success. In conjunction with that exhibition, Monet was asked to define the essence of his art. \"The richness I achieve comes from nature, the source of my inspiration,\" he said. \"Perhaps my originality boils down to my capacity as a hypersensitive receptor, and to the expediency of a shorthand by means of which I project onto a canvas, as if onto a screen, impressions registered on my retina.\"",

With his characteristically delicate touch, the Impressionist master evokes rich textures in a sumptuous color harmony of umber, yellow, red, and white. Not surprisingly, Renoir's favorite painters were Francois Boucher and Jean-Honorè Fragonard, 18th-century artists who specialized in pretty paintings produced for an audience that was concerned, above all, with pleasure. The most directly referenced influence in Still Life with Bouquet, however, is the tradition of Realism that Édouard Manet was so thrillingly reviewing at the time. The print hanging on the wall is Manet's etched reproduction of Little Cavaliers by the 17th-century Spanish master of Realism, Diego Velazquez.",

Soon the two artists formulated and produced the initial works of Analytical Cubism.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe term Cubism came from French art critic Louis Vauxcelles, an enemy of the avant-garde. He described the early works of Braque and Picasso as reducing all elements to geometric diagrams or cubes. Fishing Boats depicts a typical fishing village on the Normandy coast, but Braque\u2014eschewing a naturalistic or impressionistic rendering\u2014chose to restrict his palette to subtle earth tones and to concentrate on the geometric shapes of boats and buildings. The paintings from this period helped to establish one of the significant developments in the history of 20th-century art.",

The stark white fabric is an eye-catching focal point, and with it Gris breaks up the dark, muted greens of the bottle and russet browns of the table and background. The artist's architectural arrangement of objects and his overlapping of shapes suggest the technique of collage (papers pasted directly to the canvas), but Gris also celebrates the act of painting with the tablecloth's play of whites and grays.",

The scene is illuminated by moonlight glinting across the wet, scaly bodies of the fish and reflected in their large, staring eyes.\r\n\t\r\n\tGoya departs from traditional artistic depictions of dead animals, investing his still lifes with great pathos. Parallels can be drawn between Goya's representation of animals and his treatment of human corpses in his riveting series of prints Disasters of War, one of the greatest accusations against the horrors of war.",

His most significant and certainly his most affecting contribution to the art of sculpture are his tombs. This plaster cast of Virtue in mourning is a working model for the magnificent tomb of Archduchess Maria Christina in Vienna. Commissioned in 1798 at the wish of her grieving husband, the tomb with its procession of celestial figures was meant as an expression of her fondly cherished virtues. The handling of this highly finished model suggests the care and attention that Canova paid to the design and construction of the renowned tomb.",

The theme of vanitas, Latin for \"emptiness,\" was popular in 17th-century Dutch art, intended to symbolize the transitory nature of earthly life and the inevitability of death.\r\n\t\r\n\tFerdinand Bol was one of Rembrandt van Rijn's most gifted and successful pupils. Bol enjoyed considerable success as an independent artist, but his works reflect the strong debt in both style and subject to the work of his master. Like Rembrandt, Bol was interested in the effects of light, as can be seen here in the idealized face of the young woman bathed in a warm light against a dark background. The glistening details of her costume and jewelry glow with a vivid naturalness, the strong contrasts worked up very much in a Rembrandtesque manner of chiaroscuro, or arrangement of light and dark. Bol also captures something of the mood and tender character of Rembrandt's art of this period with the manner in which the young woman gazes at herself in the mirror. Her identity has not been confirmed, but she may be Rembrandt's wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh, who was repeatedly painted in fancy costume by Rembrandt and his pupils.",

In the late 1930s, Giacometti began to reevaluate his representation of the human form, at first reducing and then expanding the mass and volume of his figures.\r\n\t\r\n\tFollowing World War II, lone standing figures with furrowed surfaces became the primary subject of his work. By 1950 Giacometti resolved his work into three major themes he believed could express the totality of life: the standing woman, the walking man, and the portrait bust. In Tall Figure, Giacometti reduces the form of a woman to a thin line, and the viewer sees her as if reflected across a great distance. At the same time, the densely molded features suggest an almost clinically intimate examination. Yet the piece also attests to the human condition of the era. The fragile attenuation of the human form speaks to the anxiety of life in postwar Europe.",

      "about" : "In the mid-1980s, Sir Anthony Caro contemplated making a kind of war and peace sculpture. The result was his Trojan War series, an installation comprising nearly 40 individual sculptures that depict the story from Homer's Iliad. One of the components\u2014The Achaians-Xanthos\u2014bears all the hallmarks of Caro's best sculpture: linear steel elements; earthy, primitive forms; and a poetic power of composition.\r\n\t\r\n\tMany of the individual works in Trojan War, including The Achaians-Xanthos, feature ceramic elements. The Achaians were people who lived in ancient Greece. Xanthos depicts one of the two immortal horses that drew the chariot of Greek hero Achilles in the story.\r\n\t\r\n\tCaro is considered one of the most influential figures in post-World War II British art. Early in his career, he worked as an assistant to artist Henry Moore and made figural sculpture. After meeting sculptor David Smith during a 1959 visit to the United States, Caro began to construct abstract metal sculpture using industrial parts.\r\n\t \r\n\tIn 1975, Caro was one of the painters and sculptors who worked in the \"New Works in Clay\" project at Syracuse University. Although not trained as a ceramist, he had worked with ceramics before, and clay has played an important role in Caro's career ever since.",

      "about" : "Painter-turned-photographer Gustave Le Gray is best known for his landscape photographs of the forest of Fontainebleau in France. The elegantly twisting branches are the primary emphasis of this photograph, but in the background at left is a subtle testament to Le Gray's own work: the wagon he used to transport his photographic equipment.\r\n\t\r\n\tLe Gray's photography career spanned a variety of genres, from portraiture to scenes of city life in Paris. He became one of the most influential 19th-century French photographers, not only because of the striking quality of his images but also for the innovations he brought to the then-burgeoning field. The most important contribution Le Gray made to photography was the discovery that the thin application of a wax coating on the paper negative before it was sensitized decreased the exposure time and increased the amount of detail in the final image. As a result, photographs could be much more incisive and detailed, with a wider range of values.\r\n\t\r\n\tOriginally a royal hunting preserve, Fontainebleau had been turned into a public park. The forest became a popular destination for artists because its rich and varied terrain was relatively accessible from Paris. Le Gray made several photographic portraits of individual trees at Fontainebleau. Although he did not identify this beautiful hollow oak, it may be La Reine Blanche (Snow White), named by other artists working in the forest and commonly used as convenient storage for painting supplies and other gear. Le Gray's inclusion of his wagon is an allusion to plein-air photography, which was the movement of photographers out of the studios and into the open country.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Le Gray in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

In this early work, Van Ostade portrayed the rowdier side of peasant behavior, an effect heightened by the unsteadiness of both the figures and the architecture. A young boy beats a girl with a spoon amid a group of reveling adults at right, and two people at left tend to the fire. The refined pinks and blues contrast with the brown tones and, along with the dramatic use of light, intensify the crudeness of the scene. Van Ostade's later works tend to present peasants behaving in a more proper fashion.",

Located directly in front of the Berlin Wall, Moritzplatz was the favored gathering place of German \"Neue Wilden\u201d (New Wilds) artists and punks. In the late 1970s, Schobinger had begun to work with found objects encountered in daily life. For years, he amassed and stored this cultural detritus in his studio until he found uses for the various objects, a process that allowed him to create jewelry with layered and complex meanings. The artistic movements of Dada and Surrealism also played a defining role in shaping Schobinger\u2019s aesthetic. Often his messages came in the form of social criticism; at other times, such as with the \"Scherben vom Moritzplatz Berlin\" Necklace, they reflected the turbulent political climate of Europe, both past and present.",

According to the famous 16th-century biographer Giorgio Vasari, Sebastiano trained with Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini in Venice and was also influenced by Renaissance painter Giorgione. In 1511, Sebastiano went to Rome, where he formed both a friendship and professional relationship with Michelangelo, under whose guidance Sebastiano developed a distinctive, powerful, and original personal style. Vasari praised this particular work, writing that the artist made it appear \"to be not painted but really alive. . . . The head and hands of the portrait were things truly marvelous, to say nothing of the beautiful execution of the velvets, the linings, the satins, and all the other parts of the picture . . . all Florence was amazed at this portrait of Anton Francesco.\"",

As curator Gary Garrels wrote, Struth \"asks us, the audience, to assume multiple roles. We share with the . . . visitors a relationship with the [art] in the photograph . . .

Coarsely gouged-out areas, jagged lines, and the textured grain of the wood effectively combine in this portrayal of a fervent believer. The brooding face confronts the viewer with an immediacy and deep emotion that leave no doubt about the prophet\u2019s spirituality. Three years before Nolde executed Prophet, while recovering from an illness, he experienced a religious transformation. Afterward, he began depicting religious subjects in paintings and prints. Art historians have suggested that the hollow eyes, furrowed brow, and sunken cheeks of this figure represent a self-portrait. Regardless, the figure\u2019s messianic countenance is considered one of the quintessential prints of German Expressionism.",

Here, he creates an animated stage for a tragic drama.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe title of the painting is a pun that plays on The Song of the Nibelungen, an epic poem from the 13th century adapted by composer Richard Wagner in the influential 19th-century opera known as the \"Ring Cycle.\" The plot revolves around a magic ring that grants the power to rule. Adolph Hitler was a great admirer of the opera, seeing in it the embodiment of his own vision for the German nation.\r\n\t\r\n\tFor Kiefer, The Sorrow of the Nibelungen reflects not only the tragic ending of the saga, but also the perversion of German history in the 20th century.\r\n\tBy changing one word in the title of the poem\u2014using the word sorrow\r\n\t(\"leid\" in German) in place of the word song (\"lied\")\u2014Kiefer transforms\r\n\tthe popular legend into an elegy for the dead. He memorializes the slain protagonists of the poem by writing their names beside pools of blood on the floor. The grand space of the timbered room is based on the attic studio where Kiefer was working at the time. The swirling lines of the wood grain and the dramatic illusion of deep space set the stage for the drama.",

      "about" : "In the early 1910s, Amedeo Modigliani abandoned painting to concentrate on sculpture and related drawings. Caryatid is from a series of 60 drawings Modigliani made in preparation for a group of monumental sculptures. In these drawings, he transforms the load-bearing caryatid into the quintessential embodiment of someone carrying a burden.\r\n\r\n\tThe Caryatid series marks a transition in Modigliani\u2019s style from the Cézannism and Expressionism of his early work to his mature style, in which he assimilated sculpture\u2014Cycladic, Archaic Greek, and non-European, especially African\u2014into his oeuvre. Ranging in scale, color, and medium, all of these drawings depict compressed female figures supporting unspecified architectural structures. Exceptional in its large size and cool hues, this drawing exemplifies Modigliani\u2019s personal idiom of strong linear rhythms, simple elongated forms, and verticality. Perched on a pedestal, the seated caryatid reaches her arms behind her head, which she gingerly tucks into her shoulder. That he produced relatively few sculptures during his career was one of the greatest disappointments of Modigliani\u2019s life. Today, approximately 25 stone and wooden sculptures exist, only one of which is a caryatid. Nevertheless, the style of this series heavily influenced his paintings from 1915 to 1920.",

To create his abstractions, Richter applies paint onto the canvas and then scrapes and wipes it away to reveal layers of painterly sediment.\r\n\r\n\tRichter's Rhombus Cycle was originally intended for a Franciscan church in southern Italy, after architect Renzo Piano invited Richter in 1997 to create a group of paintings inspired by the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Richter chose to symbolize the saint\u2019s life through rhombus-shaped (or diamond-shaped) paintings, evoking the Wounds of Christ that are said to have miraculously appeared on St. Francis's body when the saint was praying.\r\n\r\n\tVivid shades of orange dominate the surface of this work. Richter\u2019s scraping reveals darker colors underneath, creating a sense of glow. The rhombic shape, slightly greater in width than height, draws the viewer\u2019s eye from one painting to the next, an effect compounded by the horizontal layers of paint. Although Rhombus Cycle captures the intensity of its theme, Richter's abstract interpretation did not meet with the approval of the church's commissioners, so the work was never installed there.",

Whether a cast of a mattress or of an entire room, Whiteread\u2019s sculpture references its source and the history embedded within it.\r\n\r\n\tWhiteread is known for her inside-out casts, in which the original object or space determines the sculpture\u2019s shape, but Untitled (Fire Escape) departs from this strategy. A cast of ambient\u2014as opposed to enclosed\u2014space, it declares a certain independence from its origin. Instead of taking a direct cast, Whiteread made molds and cast the staircase in segments in the studio. She then reconfigured the three flights of stairs, joining them at the center with a shared landing, to create an abstract, geometric shape. Untitled (Fire Escape) marks a culmination in Whiteread\u2019s career, merging a variety of past concerns and themes: the domestic object on an architectural scale, the cast of a void supplemented by artistic prerogative, and the formal abstraction, latent in earlier ventures, now realized in full force.",

Picasso derived his composition from the sculptural reliefs of classical Greek grave stelae. The women do not interact with one another, but are united by their bulky physiques and their drapery, which transforms their bodies into freestanding fluted columns. Picasso lends the figures a 3-D quality with simple, geometric forms and a strong emphasis on line. He developed his personal form of Neoclassicism concurrent with his continuing investigations of Cubism.",

      "about" : "Although he trained as a painter, Christian Boltanski is best known for his installations of found photographs, which he combines with light sources. In these glowing, altar-like assemblages, Boltanski looks at the construction and representation of memory.\r\n\r\n\tThe title of this work references the horrors of genocide, both of the distant past and of contemporary times. Purim, from the biblical Book of Esther, is the celebration of the failed plot to annihilate the Jews of the Persian Empire. Boltanski brings this story into the 20th century. Using a 1939 picture of a group of children dressed up for a Purim celebration, Boltanski rephotographed each face, enlarging the images until most identifying details were lost. He then mounted the cropped faces above biscuit tins, once commonly used as lunch boxes by French children. Around each photograph he installed small electric lights, as if they were votive candles. Monuments (La Fête du Pourim) is an oblique memorial, powerfully conveying a sense of human loss and collective trauma.",

In those circumstances, you just couldn't use a kitchen chair.\"\r\n\r\n\tAlthough only two chairs were made for the Barcelona, the design was considered so successful that the chair was immediately put into production. This rare example, from the first year of manufacture, was assembled with hand-secured screws and expensive lap joints. The leather cushions were hand-tufted and stuffed with horsehair. In later production, the individual elements were welded together and the leather cushions had a much thinner profile. Except for a 16-year break, the Barcelona chair has been in continuous production since its original design.",

Although he never had any formal education as an architect, his career encompassed structural designs as well as furniture. Metal was Prouvé's preferred material: steel, iron, and aluminum provided the basis for his designs. In this manner, he was part of a circle of French architects and designers such as Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Charlotte Perriand, and Robert Mallet-Stevens, all of whom experimented with the machine aesthetics and tensile strength of metal in their designs. Prouvé eventually established his own atelier for the production of furniture and components. Through this firm, he collaborated with contemporaries as well as fabricating his own work.\r\n\r\n\tThis Folding Chair is one of six that Prouvé created as a wedding present for his sister Marianne. The chairs were designed so that when not in use, they would nest together; their folded frames occupying a small space. This example is made of tubular steel, its individual elements hand-beaten\u2014a direct tie back to Prouve's early training as a wrought-iron craftsman.",

      "about" : "Born into a family of musicians, Paul Klee was an accomplished violinist. After much hesitation, he chose to study art. Alternately whimsical and spiritual, playful and rigorous, no other figure moved so effortlessly between such a variety of styles, subjects, and media as Klee. From 1898 to 1901, Klee studied in Munich, first with Heinrich Knirr, then at the Kunstakademie under Franz von Stuck. Next, Klee embarked on a series of trips abroad that nourished his visual sensibilities. After visiting Tunisia in 1914, he became entranced by color, which would become a dominant force of Klee's mature style. For the next 20 years, his paintings and watercolors showed a mastery of delicate, dreamlike color harmonies, which he manipulated to create flat, semi-abstract compositions.\r\n\r\n\tThis mosaic-like cityscape not only reveals his theoretical approach to color but also illustrates his skills as a draftsman. Klee taught at the Bauhaus, the most progressive arts and design school of the early 20th century, from 1921 to 1931. He was an eloquent writer, and his lectures, letters, and diaries\u2014many published posthumously\u2014have had a profound impact on artists and art theory.",

After viewing an exhibition of Japanese ukiyo-e prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, Bonnard adopted their bold contours, flat passages of color, and asymmetrical compositions into his work. His primary print medium was lithography, in which he created more than 120 editioned projects between 1891 and 1947. Vollard kept this print as part of his private collection. When he died in 1939, another Parisian dealer, Henri M. Petiet, purchased Vollard\u2019s entire stock from the estate. Like Vollard, Petiet refused to sell these prints and they began to be dispersed only after his death in 1980. Today, these scarce, pristine prints are highly sought after by collectors.",

      "about" : "Seventeenth-century connoisseurs prized Rembrandt's etchings as much as they did his oil paintings. Jupiter and Antiope is the most powerfully erotic etching of his late period. Rembrandt created approximately 290 etchings, many postcard-size or smaller, depicting landscapes, portraits, and biblical, mythological, and genre scenes. Jupiter and Antiope is one of only a handful of his prints illustrating explicitly sexual content.\r\n\t\r\n\tAccording to Roman legend, the god Jupiter was so entranced by the beauty of the princess Antiope that he disguised himself as a satyr and took her by force. Here, Rembrandt illustrates the moment before Jupiter wakes the princess, who reclines in a highly artificial pose. The satyr conforms to the conventional appearance of the creature, but the face is undoubtedly that of Rembrandt himself. Pulling away the sheet, he voyeuristically admires Antiope's body.\r\n\t\r\n\tJupiter and Antiope is also the artist's last rendering of a story from classical mythology. By incorporating large white areas of negative space, Rembrandt intensifies the gentle, dreamlike eroticism of the subject. This print borrows heavily from Annibale Carracci's depiction of the myth, and, in turn, Rembrandt's rendering later inspired one of Pablo Picasso's most famous prints, Faun Unveiling a Sleeping Girl.",

An inventive draftsman and painter, his impact was widespread and long lasting as a result of the prints that reproduced his paintings.

Inscribed on the ribbon over the saint, who is recognizable by his attributes of the bow and arrow, is the phrase Laet die boeren haer keermis houven, or \"Let the peasants hold their kermis.\" This slogan was a protest against an edict of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V limiting the kermis to a single day because of the notorious drunken excesses associated with the fête.",

After attending the Royal Academy of Art in Berlin from 1833 to 1834, Menzel worked initially in printmaking, then began to concentrate on oil painting. Menzel strongly advocated the medium of drawing, which held a greatly important position in his oeuvre. An obsessive draftsman, he sketched from life, carrying a notebook and carpenter's pencil at all times to record the faces or unconscious poses of strangers who caught his attention. In Study of a Man with a Beard, His Hand in His Pocket, Menzel meticulously records a working man's wispy hair, long scraggly beard, and facial features, which stand in stark contrast to the smudged passages of the coat. Despite the man's relaxed pose, his darting eyes energize his passive stance. To the right, Menzel experimented by re-sketching his subject's face at a slightly more-frontal angle.",

The etchings comprising this series were sold individually or published in volumes. Imaginary View of Padua is a first-state impression with bold contrasts between the light and dark passages.

In reality, gathering cotton was exhausting. The success of cotton plantations in the Deep South changed the lives of slaves, causing a massive involuntary migration of African Americans. This was sometimes called the Second Middle Passage; the first Middle Passage refers to the shipment of Africans across the Atlantic to the Americas. As slave owners from the Upper South sold their slaves to cotton growers in places like Mississippi and Alabama to staff new plantations, families and long-time communities were destroyed. This migration created new lifestyles and changed African American culture. Southern slaves concentrated on their families, religion, and culture in order to survive the brutal labor system in which they lived.\r\n\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

Born a slave in the United States during the late 1700s, Molineaux gained his freedom after years of boxing in tournaments for his owner. A brash, talented fighter, Molineaux traveled to England to challenge the greatest boxer of the day, Tom Cribb.\r\n\r\n\tAfter winning several fights against boxers in England, Molineaux represented a challenge to British society. Could a black man\u2014and an American at that\u2014defeat the most powerful English athlete of the age? The image of black defeating white, whether in the ring or on the plantation, was a terrifying one for white men across the Atlantic world.\r\n\r\n\tIn the end, after 40 rounds, Molineaux yielded to Cribb, and Molineaux eventually spiraled into a depression that led to his early death. The figurine of Molineaux, pictured here on the right, shows him in the midst of those many rounds that took place on a rainy December day in 1810. In a solid stance with his bare knuckles ready to strike, Molineaux is confident and capable.\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

      "about" : "The novel Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe intensified an already hot debate over slavery throughout the United States. One of the central stories of the book revolves around the heroic escape of the slave Eliza with her child, as shown in the vase on the left.\r\n\t\r\n\tCompared to Eliza\u2019s stance against oppression is that of Tom, a lovable and loyal slave, in the right vase. Tom comes to love and be loved as a friend by Eva, the slave owners\u2019 daughter, a sickly young girl who stole the hearts of thousands of readers in the mid-1800s. Tom and Eva\u2019s relationship, found on the second vase, was built on the negative stereotype of the slave as gentle, obedient, and eternally happy, even while he or she is enslaved.\r\n\r\n\tThese vases show two different ways that African Americans responded to oppression: Eliza took freedom into her own hands by running away, while Tom carved out the best life possible within slavery. The vases also illustrate one way that white Americans understood and represented slavery. Made in Europe and likely owned by a wealthy white family, these vases display how slavery and anti-slavery images became popular on household goods throughout America and Europe.\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

Anticipating the Impressionist innovation of painting en plein air (French for \"in the open air\"), Corot sketched outdoors, then returned to his studio to translate his carefully arranged compositions into paintings depicting mythological and biblical subjects. This drawing's high degree of finish suggests that it was a presentation drawing\u2014a drawing created as a finished work of art, not as a stage in preparation for a work in another medium. Corot achieved the enchanting variations of the texture, shadow, and form in the drawing by simply changing the angle and pressure of his pencil.",

The process allowed for the handles of vases and spouts of teapots to be formed as one piece with the body rather than being cast separately and added on later. As seen in this rare large example, the resulting forms were attenuated, eccentric, and flamboyant.",

To him, skulls represent life, not death. A skull carved from coral is suspended in a mirror attached to two bands of gold. In order to see the skull, the wearer must look in the mirror. From this perspective, both the face of the skull and the face of the wearer are simultaneously visible.\r\n\r\n\tThe ring is accompanied by a watercolor and ink drawing. Its only text is the name of the French philosopher René Descartes, a revolutionary thinker who questioned and changed prevailing attitudes about the relationship between philosophy and theology.

The photographer, Nadar, concentrated on the psychological aspects of portraiture and is one of the most important portraitists of the 19th century.\r\n\t\r\n\tA pioneer of early photography, Gaspard Fèlix Tournachon, who adopted the pseudonym of Nadar at the beginning of his career, became one of the first photographers to promote portraiture commercially to enhance the public image of the sitter. Because Nadar started as an accomplished satirical caricaturist, his portraits conveyed the personalities of his photographic subjects. He was adept at locating the distinct and revealing elements of their faces.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs a journalist, ringmaster, political agitator, balloonist, caricaturist, and novelist, the charismatic Nadar was in a position to befriend many of the most important cultural figures in France. In the 1840s, he became friends with his idol, Alexandre Dumas père. (Père is the French title to distinguish father from son, similar to \"Sr.\" in English.) Nadar had long admired Dumas, and in fact an earlier portrait of Dumas hung in Nadar's childhood room. They made plans to collaborate on a play together in 1855, but the project never came to fruition.\r\n\t\r\n\tNadar opened his first photography studio in 1854. Six years later he moved it to 35 Boulevard des Capucines, a large space that his colleagues\u2014photographers Gustave Le Gray and the Bisson brothers\u2014had vacated. Nadar left the studio's operation to others but continued to entertain friends and intellectuals there. In 1874 his son, Paul Nadar, became the manager. Paul carried on his father's innovative spirit, continuing to experiment, exploring artificial lighting and methods for animating still pictures.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Nadar in the collection, contact the Museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Frozen midstride, the figure contains drama at every angle.\r\n\t\r\n\tBy 1900, Auguste Rodin was the most celebrated sculptor of his time. He worked thematically and often returned to earlier pieces in a constant revision of form. In Walking Man Rodin revisits his first masterwork, St. John the Baptist Preaching (1878\u201380). Walking Man's trunk is based on an 1878 torso study for St. John. At what point Rodin added legs to create a striding man is not documented. As the figure evolved, Rodin stripped away its narrative context. Further, he took extreme liberties in his rendition of the male physique. Walking Man's scarred surfaces reveal the artist's process; the unusual fragmentation of the body focuses attention to the figure's powerful legs. This bronze sculpture is also profoundly modern: The stance is not that of an antique statue. Rather, it embodies the thrust of contemporary urban life.",

Lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, and ditches are the essence of Dutch landscapes, certainly in the vicinity of the municipality of Haarlem.  \r\n\t\r\n\tThis painting, one of Ruysdael's finest river landscapes, includes an expanse of water animated by reflections; tonal harmony of browns and ochers; and bright skies with streaks of pink and blue, violet and gray. Ruysdael excelled in atmospheric river views, and--along with Jan van Goyen--was the leading master of this type of picture. The compositional scheme of many of Ruysdael's river scenes is as simple as it is efficient. Water covers the whole foreground and runs off slantingly toward the back. Depth is given to the scene by a building, such as a mill or a church, rising above the trees, with the horizon in the distance. Twentieth-century art historian Max J. Friedlander must have had works like this one in mind when he wrote, \"While the weather in van Goyen's pictures makes you feel it will soon rain, Ruysdael's pictures make you feel it has rained, and a fresh wind has driven the rain away.\"",

Baron Gérard's masterly achievement overwhelms with its superb formal qualities, its outstanding painterly refinement, and the accessibility of its subject matter.  \r\n\t\r\n\tNapoleon, who bestowed the title of Duke of Montebello on Lannes, may have encouraged the marriage between his ambitious young general and Louise-Antoinette-Scholastique-Guéhéneuc, a renowned beauty of noble descent. The couple belonged to the inner circle of the court of Napoleon. After Lannes, a popular hero, was killed on the battlefield in 1809, the duchess continued to be a favorite at court. But in 1814, the year this painting was commissioned, she started to withdraw, devoting herself principally to her five children. Ernest, the boy with the rackets, is the direct ancestor of Philippe de Montebello, former director of the MFAH and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.",

While working on still-life paintings in 1912, they invented the collage, in which an actual construction of cut-and-paste paper forms replaced the painted illusions of such forms.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn this work, Picasso playfully combines drawn objects (pipe, sheet music, and tabletop) with a trompe l'oeil (fool-the-eye) gilt frame (actually printed wallpaper), illusionistic cast shadows, and a signed nameplate. At the top of the sheet music Picasso has carefully lettered \"Ma Jolie\" (My Pretty), as if it were the name of the composition. In fact, it was the refrain from a popular song as well as Picasso's pet name for his mistress at the time, Eva Gouel. Picasso stenciled or penciled the phrase \"Ma Jolie\" across a number of works from this period.",

However, the painted decoration seems to have no parallel in other Philadelphia furniture, although very closely related painted decoration is documented to Baltimore. Likewise, the design of the en suite card table and pier table does not resemble that of other Philadelphia examples but relates to pieces made in Baltimore. What remains unclear is whether these chairs were made and painted in Philadelphia, made in Philadelphia and decorated in Baltimore, or made completely in Baltimore.",

The substitution of cast composition ornaments for carving, ubiquitous in the English cabinet trade, is highly unusual in America. Scottish designer Robert Adam was the first to patent composition, an amalgam of chalk, rosin, glue, and drying oil. In spite of the obvious foreign influences, this armchair, shown in the Federal Parlor at Bayou Bend, is more accurately an expression of American design and craftsmanship.",

Initially trained as a mason, he eventually became a recognized architect in Boston. Clearly, he was conversant with the bombé form, having installed a pulpit in this contour patterned after plate 112 in Batty Langley\u2019s The City and Country Builder\u2019s and Workman\u2019s Treasury of Designs, for Boston\u2019s Brattle Street Church in 1772. In addition to his copy of Langley, Dawes\u2019s extensive library included other architectural tomes by James Gibbs, William Salmon, William Pain, and Colen Campbell, as well as published furniture designs by Robert Manwaring. Perhaps these were a source of inspiration for this desk, particularly its bombé shape, writing interior, and architectronic bookcase.",

The joined chair, as its name implies, was constructed with mortise-and-tenon joints, resulting in a sturdier, more labor intensive, and therefore more expensive object. The cost became even dearer with the addition of a plump feather cushion on top of the board seat.\r\n\r\n\tThe design of this chair cannot be associated with a specific craftsman. However, like much early furniture, it is firmly rooted in British and Continental precedents. The square, tapering columnar legs and arm supports are derived from Mannerist vocabulary of 16th- and 17th-century northern Europe, whereas the flat, overhanging crest rail and carved ornament suggests a first-generation woodworker near Devon, England, where comparable carving practices date to the 1500s.

Coney\u2019s known work in the Mannerist and Baroque aesthetics establishes him as the most accomplished and versatile of all colonial silversmiths.\r\n\r\n\tThis tankard is a consummate American expression of early Baroque silver.

      "about" : "Number 6 belongs to Jackson Pollock's first triumphant period of dripped-and-poured paintings. Taking the canvas off the easel and laying it on the floor of his studio so that he could work from all four sides, Pollock dripped, poured, and flung enamel paint on the surface, eliminating brushes and literally drawing with the liquid medium.\r\n\t\r\n\tRevolutionary not only for their technique, these paintings redefined representations of space and the subject of art. Pollock's drip paintings introduced a sense of \"all-overness,\" a lack of compositional focus where any one part of the canvas is just as important or central as any other. The energetic web of color and line the concrete notation of the act of painting became the artist's subject. This active, physical style of painting is now known as Abstract Expressionism, or alternatively, Action Painting. The Abstract Expressionists were a loosely formed group of artists who came of age in post-World War II New York and were concerned with rendering emotive or psychological subject matter in abstract form.",

      "about" : "Mary Cassatt became well known for her paintings that depict women and children in domestic settings. Children in a Garden (The Nurse) is the first major Impressionist canvas of the outdoors that she painted, and it is one of her early masterworks. She included it in the eighth Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1886, and in her first major U.S. solo exhibition in 1895.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe painting shows a nursemaid knitting while seated on a bench in a flower-bordered garden. One of her charges sleeps in a nearby carriage, and the other plays at her feet. As with much of Cassatt\u2019s work that was based on closely studying family, friends, and servants, this scene offers an intimate glimpse into the private lives of the subjects and portrays the charming characteristics of children and babies without the sentimentality that distinguished so many paintings of the time.\r\n\t\r\n\tUnusual for Cassatt, however, is the work\u2019s looser application of paint, its off-center composition, and its emphasis on the landscape. The bright sunlight knits the composition together; brilliant colors sweep through the canvas; and expertly articulated figures show the artist\u2019s disciplined draftsmanship and her ability to make them lifelike through careful dabs of paint. For example, the slightly downturned mouth of the baby in its carriage, along with the hand nestled against its face for comfort, indicate deep, peaceful sleep.",

      "about" : "The artists of the Hudson River School ventured far beyond the New York region suggested in the name that was applied to them. Here, for example, Frederic Church depicts Cotopaxi, an active volcano in Ecuador. The tiny foreground figures suggest the insignificance of people in comparison with the natural wonders that surround them: the volcano, the waterfall, and the lush tropical foliage.\r\n\t\r\n\tA member of the second generation of Romantic landscape painters, Church ranks among the most influential American artists during the period between 1850 and 1875. As a youth, he studied with Thomas Cole, one of the Hudson River School founders, and Cole\u2019s renderings of the Sicilian volcano Mount Etna may have provided inspiration for Cotopaxi. More directly, Church conceived of this work following a visit to South America in 1853, after which he depicted the cone-shaped volcano repeatedly for nearly a decade.\r\n\t\r\n\tPainted at a turbulent moment in America\u2019s history, before the outbreak of the Civil War, Cotopaxi embodies Church's response to current events. The smoldering volcano in the background carries portents of destruction, and the palm tree\u2014which does not exist on the actual site of Cotopaxi\u2014symbolizes both Latin America and the Garden of Eden. In addition to containing inherent moralistic messages, awe-inspiring American Romantic landscape paintings such as this one also served as documents of distant, exotic sites in the era before photography and modern travel.",

While in Munich, Chase also mastered a bravura, painterly brush technique that would distinguish his work throughout his life. Here, his bold brushwork is particularly apparent in the treatment of the glittering surfaces of the coral and bells, white lace gown, and Japanese embroidery on the mother\u2019s robe.\r\n\r\n\tThis grand, full-length painting was exhibited at numerous venues, including the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It received many positive reviews, including one by Chase\u2019s student Kenyon Cox, who stated, \u201cthe main beauty of the canvas is indescribable . . . the beauty of two tones of black, one upon the other . . . the tingling pleasure that one receives from the one note of vivid scarlet that cuts through this quiet harmony like a knife?\u201d",

      "about" : "Cindy Sherman has built her career on examining the role of celebrity and fame in American culture, and her photographs create a lively artistic discourse about self-performance photography. She stars in all her photographs, and in her series Untitled Film Stills, she explores the roles women play in the movies. Here, Sherman buries her head in a pillow while the light catches her blond wig and shiny negligee. Resembling a scene from a B movie, the picture invites viewers to invent a story about it.\r\n\t \r\n\tBy using herself as a model, Sherman makes photographs that deconstruct popular forms of celebrity representation, including film stills. \"I like the idea that different people can see different things in the same image, even if that's not what I would want them to see,\" she says. This series, which she began in 1977, tampers with the ways popular images simultaneously define and mask true identity. In the photographs she assumes the persona of a fictional character in a nonexistent film. She insinuates plot and adopts fabricated identities through props, costumes, and poses. Once the scene has been fully staged, Sherman photographs herself using a hidden remote-shutter release. The resulting image looks much like a traditional movie still or publicity photo, but in reality questions whether it is acceptable for a portrait just to have instantaneous appeal, or whether it must offer true psychological or emotional revelations about the subject.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Sherman in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Nixon captured his subjects with dignity and respect at a time when people with AIDS had generally been derided and victimized. Nixon, working with an 8x10-inch camera, shot images that are crisply detailed and powerfully sentimental. Although this bulky camera would have been somewhat awkward to use, Nixon's photographs have a snapshot quality, a testament to his talent and skill.\r\n\t\r\n\tJoey Brandon with his Parents, Zena and Everett Cloy, Boston, Oct., 1987 is the first of four photographs documenting the last months of Joey Brandon's struggle with the disease. In this image he is still in a state of relatively good health. As each photograph in the series shows the deterioration not only in Brandon's physical condition, but also in his spirit, Nixon demonstrates the power of photography to capture the passage of time through portraiture. Nixon is most famous for his series The Brown Sisters, a project that documents four sisters with one photograph every year. The MFAH owns the complete series of both People with AIDS and The Brown Sisters, among other prints by Nixon.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Nixon in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

      "about" : "Based in Los Angeles, John Baldessari is one of the most influential conceptual artists of his generation. This installation consists of five photographs that were matted, framed, and then hung askew. The sixth frame contains an anecdote about jazz musician Thelonious Monk that illuminates the concept of the work:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\"There's a story about Thelonious Monk going around his apartment tilting all the pictures hanging on the wall. It was his idea of teaching his wife a different kind of order. When she saw the pictures askew on the wall she would straighten them. And when Monk saw them straightened on the wall, he would tilt them. Until one day his wife left them hanging on the wall tilted.\"\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\tBaldessari began as a painter but in 1970 dramatically renounced his painting career and vowed to make only Post-Studio Art. Here, he not only demonstrates the literally tilted frames of the Monk story but also creates an analogy for a different type of order in the representation of art. By tilting his own frames, Baldessari asks viewers to consider why they were so committed to a perfectly straight frame when there is more than one way that an object can be presented.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Baldessari in the Museum's collection, contact the <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Rothko used layers of thinned paint, soaked into the canvas, to create nuances of tone that gradually emerged as ethereal, floating rectangles of color. In contrast to the Action Painters, he worked to eliminate the gestural line, creating instead vast areas of color to envelop the viewer.\r\n\t\r\n\tRothko viewed color as a means to express emotions, a medium through which paint and canvas could be transformed into the sublime. In this painting, the close hues of the dark colors are punctuated by the vibrant drama of the red band on top. The subtle shifts of color between the lower two rectangular forms and the dark ground create a quiet luminosity that is both majestic and tragic. The shimmering and flickering light, along with the pulsating colors that alternately project and recede, offer an impression of continual movement.",

He produces provocative photographs of man-altered landscape and is most famous for his lifetime project the Desert Cantos series. Begun in 1979, these images examine the complex interaction between humans and nature, aesthetics, politics, and ecology, particularly of the American West. Misrach's photographs are incredibly beautiful, yet they address social issues in a critical and provocative way.\r\n\t\r\n\tAlthough Misrach considers all of his desert photography to be part of one single work, he has divided the pictures into subseries called \"cantos,\" each representing a song in a song cycle or a stanza in a love poem, visually examining a different aspect of desert life. Though he originally started with four cantos (representing the four elements: earth, air, water, and fire), he continually adds new ones. This image from Canto IV shows a controlled agricultural fire, set to clear alfalfa fields. The beauty of the scene of a desert fire demonstrates the complexity of Misrachís approach, juxtaposing the formal splendor of the dramatic and expressive color against the sobering implication of air pollution.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Misrach in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

After initially absorbing the lessons of Modernism and embracing an abstract, vivid style, Benton turned in the 1920s to developing what he considered an \u201cauthentic American art,\u201d an art that was socially responsible and never aesthetically hermetic.\r\n\t\r\n\tA solid technician in the studio, Benton pioneered a painterly technique of applying pigment with egg yolk and water, and then overlaying the surface with transparent glazes. The rich tones and sensuous surfaces of his paintings are the result of this technique and of his heavily managed brushwork, in which he picked details out of the wet surface of the paint. In Haystack, the spiraling motion implicit in the hay coiled on the central pole is echoed throughout the painting, where content and artistic process meld seamlessly as Benton weaves together sky, earth, and farmer into one holistic vision of rural life in Missouri.",

Each painting varies in terms of the number, width, placement, and color of the circles. Working from the center outward, Noland applied paint directly onto raw canvas so that it soaked into the material, achieving an extraordinary degree of chromatic vibrancy. The visual drama of Half is in part due to the contrast between the expansive painterliness of the outermost circle and the more restrained geometries of the inner circles. The shifting color values add further drama, ranging from cool green to a deep celestial blue, creating an image that seems to bloom and pulsate, expand and contract.",

Drake moved with his family from the Texas Panhandle to El Paso in the 1960s.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the mid-1980s, Drake began a project titled Juarez/El Paso, which responded to specific border events. During the summer of 1987, 18 undocumented immigrants suffocated to death when the boxcar in which they were hiding was sidelined outside the town of Sierra Blanco, near El Paso. One man survived, and he later recounted that the ìcoyoteî who had arranged their passage deliberately locked the boxcar, throwing them a crowbar before closing the door.\r\n\t\r\n\tJuarez/El Paso (Boxcar) memorializes this incident. Drake offers a vivid image of the isolated boxcar. Drawn in charcoal and framed in steel, it has a material affinity with the actual coal, railroad spikes, and crowbar that are placed in the foreground. The two-part drawing and installation forces the viewer to empathize with the men who lost their lives trying to enter the United States.",

      "about" : "Here, in a drinking game called \"walking the chalk,\" a drunkard is challenged to see whether he is sober enough to walk in a straight line marked on the tavern floor. The work brilliantly expresses two major themes that dominated early American genre paintings: the growing concern about divisions between the North and South in the pre-Civil War years, and the social interactions among ordinary Americans in public places.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis lively tavern scene by American painter Charles Deas is rich with hidden meanings that audiences would have understood in the 1830s. The figure of the con man \"thumbs his nose\" (as much a sign of indignation in the 19th century as it is today) and invites the viewer to question the scene as a scam. Although commonly a sign of fidelity, the slouched dog may refer to the popular phrase \"drunk as a dog,\" raising concerns about the excessive consumption of alcohol that would culminate in the temperance movement. The issue of slavery is suggested by the presence of the African American straddling the line, expressing the mounting apprehensions about national unity and balance as states entered the Union as either slave-holding or free. Such is the stuff of 19th-century American genre paintings that their potential meanings may be endlessly discussed and debated, the very feature of U.S. democracy that this art form aimed to celebrate.",

      "about" : "In the 1960s a new artistic style overtook New York. Known as Pop Art and defined by its cool impersonality, this style embraced American popular culture, utilizing comics, tabloid photographs, and movie stills as artistic inspiration. Perhaps the best-known Pop artist was Andy Warhol, who conceived a new idea of the artist as celebrity.\r\n\r\n\tAcross his career, Warhol worked in the traditional genre of portraiture.\r\n\tHis portraits of celebrities such as Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley were taken from publicity stills and newspaper photographs. He used these portraits not only to question the originality of the artistic image but also to explore themes of death, celebrity, and postwar culture.\r\n\r\n\tIn this ghost-like self-portrait, produced a few months before his death, Warhol stares out at the viewer with an impenetrable glare. The artist\u2019s disembodied head floats against an inky black background, his image silkscreened in a pale violet. Slack-jawed and wearing a platinum fright wig, Warhol likens his face to a skull or death mask.",

In The Sneak, for example, an act of violence has taken place.\r\n\t\r\n\tThree small figures, gossiping behind the back of the central character, reach out to separate a couple. The woman lies on the ground, bleeding; the man has her blood on his hands and an angry sneer on his face. Is he a husband who heard people talk about his wife sneaking around? Or have the three sneaks acted as puppet masters in inciting the violence?\r\n\t\r\n\tThroughout her career, Scott has engaged in the realms of jewelry, sculpture, performance art, and installation. She began using beads in her jewelry in the mid-1970s, after working with Native American and African artists at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine. Amazingly, her pieces have no internal armature or backing. Rather, she constructs fluid, sculptural figures using a traditional Native American peyote stitch to sew thousands of colored beads into compelling compositions.",

Where the projection hit the wall (or corner) it became a sharply defined geometric form, both actual and illusionary.\r\n\r\n\tAcro, Green, from this founding stage in Turrell's career, is created by projecting a single, controlled beam of light from the opposing corner\r\n\tof the room. As it hits the corner, the projected light gives the illusion of a three-dimensional cubic form. The first version of this corner installation was created in 1967 with white light. A year later, Turrell made this variation in green\u2014a color he uses sparingly.",

By ennobling an ordinary bathtub, Rauschenberg conjures an air of grace in decline.\r\n\t\r\n\tFor half a century, Texas-born Rauschenberg stood as one of the most prolific and celebrated figures in American art. With an artistic practice characterized by vigor, curiosity, and intellect, he continuously moved across the realms of painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, dance, and performance.\r\n\t\r\n\tSor Aqua alludes not only to Venice's canals but also to its grand, deteriorating architecture. Yet the rusted materials evoke something more ethereal: the levitating forms are both awkward and otherworldly. Floating in between the genres of sculpture and installation art, Sor Aqua sets up a powerful opposition of form and metaphor.",

Displaced by the Korean War in 1950, Paik traveled the world, residing in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Munich, and New York. Paik's experiences across the globe led him not only to realize the artistic potential of tech-\r\n\tnology, but also to measure the distance from his native Korean culture.\r\n\r\n\tPaik directly confronts the issues of assimilation and modernization in his two-channel video image Rose Art Memory by combining modern and traditional influences. Arranged in a grid format, 14 monitors set to one channel encircle six monitors set to a different channel. The two videos stream simultaneously, generating a pulsating and hypnotic effect. Inscribed within each corner of the traditional, red lacquer frame are the four points of the compass, thus linking the piece to a specific Asian heritage.\r\n\t\r\n\tCreated the year Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympic Games, Rose Art Memory profoundly conveys the experience of impermanence and instability within a hyper-stimulating medium. Furthermore, by juxtaposing ultramodern tech-\r\n\tnology against traditional framework, Paik questions whether such extreme cultural changes will ultimately lead to the degradation of a rich history.",

Oldenburg's jarring sense of scale and unexpected use of materials make his reconstructions of everyday objects appear imposing, yet also soft and droopy. He reverses the viewer's expectations of what makes a monumental sculpture. The subtitle of this work, Ghost Version, refers to the sculpture's white color; Oldenburg also made a companion Giant Soft Fan in black vinyl, now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.",

Judd worked in a pared-down aesthetic with industrially produced materials, a style that came to be known as Minimalism.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn his embrace of a reductive and geometric vocabulary, Judd's essential form was the box: open, closed, or even stacked in repetition. Instead of creating his pieces in a studio, Judd would have them fabricated by a factory, thereby ensuring a perfect finish. Here, Judd uses the box form to combine structure, color, and material. The brilliant red of the interior bottom reflects against the side panels, fusing surface and light. Further, by placing the object directly on the floor, as opposed to resting it on a pedestal or base, Judd not only emphasizes the object-like quality of the piece but also thrusts Untitled into the physical space of the viewer.",

Reinforcing the refined tone is the dapper rose pinned to the boy's jacket, a prop that is unique in Copley's oeuvre. The portrait's profusion of other props\u2014a battledore and shuttlecock, a braid-trimmed tricorn hat tossed to the ground, a marble or stone architectural element that existed not in the colonies but probably in a mezzotint source of Continental or English portraits\u2014and its complex landscape details point to a considerable effort on the part of Copley to impress his patrons with his knowledge of European prototypes and to flatter the boy's family.",

      "about" : "The Crying Room: A Memorial to the Ancestors bears witness to the enormous human suffering of African slaves as they were transported against their will to the Americas. Artist Vicki Meek represents the terrible history of the Middle Passage through a sophisticated layering of sources, ranging from the bleak records of the European slave ships to musical chants that attest to the survival of traditional cultures in the New World.\r\n\r\n\tDominating The Crying Room is an elaborate Yoruba ideograph representing \u201cThe Lifting of the Plate,\u201d or the final ascension that takes one from death into the realm of the ancestors. Another wall of the installation chronicles the horrifying mathematical calculations of slavers who estimated acceptable losses in human life; and the third is inscribed with symbols of hope and redemption. Upon leaving the gallery, the visitor is invited to add a personal comment to the memorial wall.\r\n\r\n\tPublic memorials are important because they allow a society or a community to reconcile its grief. The collective grief over the loss of the millions of ancestors lost during the Middle Passage and through the mass lynchings of the 20th century has never had an outlet. Consequently, this pent-up grief manifests itself in many inexplicable ways. . . . <strong>The Crying Room: A Memorial to the Ancestors <\/strong>is meant to allow us to remember and grieve for all those many ancestors whose lives were sacrificed.\r\n\t\u2014Vicki Meek",

Early in her career, Cassatt thought of herself primarily as a painter, dismissing printmaking as reproductive and mechanical, but she later realized that prints provided a locus for experimentation and variation.\r\n\r\n\tWorking first in black and white, Cassatt began incorporating color into her prints after viewing the 1890 exhibition of Japanese ukiyo-e prints at the École des Beaux-Arts. No other artist succeeded in adapting the spirit of the Japanese color woodcut to the Western medium of etching as effectively as Cassatt. In Under the Horse-Chestnut Tree, the combination of drypoint and aquatint shows remarkable juxtapositions of thin graphic lines and solid blocks of watery color. She underscores the stylistic idiom of Japonisme with flattened modeling, bold outlines, and an oblique use of perspective.",

In 1984 she remarked: \"I live in a hilly part of Texas full of scrubby trees, animals, water, and sky. Each day I observe dramas, contradictions, compromises, tensions, and endearments.\" Miller developed a series of richly allegorical paintings, essentially paradigms for the human condition, images that encompass themes of playful courtship to mortal struggle. By the late 1970s, animals became the chief protagonists in these allegories.\r\n\t\r\n\tTightly cropped, Flood focuses on the plight of three animals whose reactions to the rising waters chart a range of emotion, from the raging tiger to the crane who seems to arch its neck in despair. The one active figure in the composition is that of the crouching tiger, who tentatively tests a passing branch as a saving foothold.",

Because 19th-century German porcelain often displayed floral designs, that experience provided a good foundation for still-life painting. He may also have benefited from early exposure to 17th- and 18th-century Dutch paintings of fruit and flowers, as well as from the 19th-century works that revived the still-life tradition.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the late 1840s, Roesen immigrated to the United States, where he painted Victorian Bouquet. The opulent arrangement of morning glories, roses, irises, tulips, and other flowers, surrounded by fruits such as blackberries, apricots, and strawberries, exemplifies Roesen's crisp and luxuriant style. The artist greatly popularized still-life painting\u2014a genre that did not develop into a substantial tradition in the United States until the 1850s and 1860s\u2014and influenced American artists for generations.",

She continued to travel frequently to Central America after moving to Houston in 1962.\r\n\t\r\n\tHaiti represents an unusually political statement for the artist. The swift-moving washes of gold earth tones and the blue and white of sky and sea are united under the shadow of an ominous black center. The painting conjures the island of Haiti as a \"newly born wonder,\" she stated, lyrical yet tragic.",

This watercolor revisits three of the artist's paintings, all titled Cicada and all created by Johns during his crosshatch period. From 1972 to 1982, he worked in a linear style that he derived from a car decorated with clusters of non-intersecting parallel lines. This Cicada watercolor is the only known instance of Johns combining a finished drawing that reexamines an image he originally executed in oil with notebook-like drawings normally created as a private activity and not meant for public display. Sketches of the cicada insect--the namesake of these works and a symbol of metamorphosis--appear at the bottom of the drawing along with other symbols of regeneration. In addition, this work is historically important because it marks the first time Johns explored the Tantric imagery that would soon become a significant component of his work.",

LaSelle painted Puritan over her extended summer visits to Provincetown, the Cape Cod artists' colony where Hofmann's workshop was located. As the title suggests, the composition has a stringent and pared-down purity.

But much in the way that eyes adjust to darkness, forms and patterns begin to emerge out of the gloom, and three startled horses threatened by two wolves (or coyotes) come to light. The evocative mood and supernatural quality of this work, and others like it, made the West look like a timeless dreamworld, a quality that established Frederic Remington's nocturnes, or night scenes, among his greatest artistic achievements.\r\n\t\r\n\tRemington exhibited The Call for Help in his 1908 solo exhibition at the prestigious New York gallery Knoedler &amp; Company. The painting received superb reviews, with at least five critics singling it out for praise. The New York Times stated that the work \"tells, perhaps, the most impressive story\" of all those in the show. Other critics likewise celebrated Remington as a great storyteller and painter, as well as a preserver of the romantic and primal side of Western life.\r\n\t\r\n\tIndeed, the composition is a masterly rendering of a tense moment set within a moonlit, snowy landscape. Using black, blue, and highlights of gray, Remington suggests the musculature, sheen, and movement of the three terror-stricken horses: one cowers, another rears, while the third, partially obscured from view, presses close to the fence. The fence itself, an abstract pattern of broad bands of light and dark, marks the collision between the wildness of nature and the order of civilization, the latter represented by the log cabin and stacks of hay or grain in the background.",

The underlying grid structure that unites the composition is vividly animated by the gestural strokes that are laid down as middle and foregrounds; floating red rectangles further anchor the visual play across the surface. Filled with assurance and gusto, the work presents a brilliant palette animated by a syncopated compositional structure: it is the work of an artist at the peak of his career.",

The twisting forms that define the head and feet evoke the physical powers of a tornado and the frenetic energy of the artist as creator.

Hesse originally considered herself to be a painter, not turning to the sculpture for which she is now famous until the mid-1960s. Her early work emphasized the vibrant colors and biomorphic abstractions characteristic of first- and second-generation Abstract Expressionists.\r\n\t\r\n\tAfter experimenting with the dark tones prevalent in Old Master drawings, she returned to her earlier style, as seen in this watercolor. Hesse made works on paper throughout her career, and Untitled is among her finest mid-career works. The composition displays complex, architectonic free-form abstractions, and it was executed at the pinnacle of a time when Hesse was known strictly as a painter. In 1964 and 1965, while on a year-long trip to Germany with her husband, sculptor Tom Doyle, Hesse began to create sculptures herself. During her brief mature period\u2014before her death at age 34\u2014Hesse continually experimented with new processes and materials in order to push the boundaries of art, moving beyond definitions of figuration or abstraction.",

      "about" : "In 1966, after accepting a teaching position at UCLA, Richard Diebenkorn began working in a studio near the beach in Santa Monica's Ocean Park neighborhood. The artist soon embarked on a new cycle of paintings and drawings, collectively known as the Ocean Park works.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe light and architecture of the beach community had a profound influence on Diebenkorn's style and imagery. He abandoned his figurative vocabulary and invented an abstract language, partially reverting to his early interest in landscape-based abstraction, but rendered from an aerial perspective. Diebenkorn extrapolated the internal architecture of his Ocean Park works from the stark compositions of two paintings by Henri Matisse: View of Notre Dame and French Window at Collioure.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn this three-part work from 1972, Diebenkorn pares his Ocean Park imagery down to its most essential components. Executed in monochrome, except for the third (green) panel, Untitled is the artistís homage to the austerity of Matisse's window paintings. Realizing the centrality of this triptych to his oeuvre, Diebenkorn kept it in the living room of his Santa Monica home, a touchstone of his quarter-century-long Ocean Park series.",

      "about" : "Edward Weston took this photograph at the American Rolling Mill Company in Middletown, Ohio, in 1922 while traveling from his California studio to New York City. The image demonstrates Weston's early departure from the Pictorialist style a soft-focus approach that aimed to put photography on a par with painting in favor of a more streamlined, abstract, and sharply focused aesthetic in picture-making. When he arrived in New York City and met Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles Sheeler, and Paul Strand, among others, they influenced Weston to continue his exploration of Modernism in photography.\r\n\t \r\n\tIn Armco Steel, Weston created a powerful and overall abstract composition. This effect is derived from the bold and dynamic vertical thrust of seven tall smokestacks that appear as one wide stepped tower, and from the interaction of the smokestacks with the curved and horizontal pipes, all against a background of factory and office buildings that themselves form a Modernist grid. This photograph symbolizes the power, wealth, scale, and significance of the steel industry in 1920s America.\r\n\t\r\n\tWeston was best known for his landscapes of the American West, particularly of the Northern California coast. Along with other important photographers such as Ansel Adams and Imogen Cunningham, he was a founding member of Group f/64. His influence was further extended by the publication of his diaries, in which he wrote of his aesthetics as well as of his life.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Weston in  the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Chase\u2019s deceptively simple composition testifies to his ability to make the ordinary seem extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\tOriginally from the Midwest, Chase studied at the National Academy of Design in New York, and then in Europe at the Munich Academy, where artists were encouraged to depict ordinary subject matter, and to handle paint broadly using a limited, dark palette enlivened with small bits of bright color. After further study and travel abroad, Chase returned to New York, where he became a highly visible art figure known for his generosity, eclecticism, and charisma, and for his Impressionist scenes of public parks and his bold portraits.\r\n\r\n\tChase\u2019s most consistent and brilliant body of work is the series of Impressionist landscapes he painted from 1891 to 1902, during summers at Shinnecock. This imposing example provides a fresh, seemingly spontaneous interpretation of the movement of clouds and sunlight and their effects on the coastal landscape below. Sandwiched in between the scraggly clumps of dune grass, heather, and sky are pink dunes highlighted by a streak of red, and a sliver of sea dotted with white boats.",

Paley made jewelry for an incredibly prolific 10 years, during which he set new standards for American jewelry with his large-scale, humanistic, technically superior, and ornamental works designed to work with the body, not merely to decorate it.\r\n\r\n\tPaley began first casting, then chasing, gold and silver\u2014his preferred materials. Soon he was using forging techniques, which allowed him to achieve an aesthetic best described as Abstract Lyricism, with flowing curves and otherworldly nature reminiscent of Art Nouveau (but not based on the style) and with technique linked to the spontaneous working methods of the Abstract Expressionists. For Double Fibula Brooch, Paley forged the two separate disks, each with a swinging pin, from a design based on the Celtic penannular brooch. By beveling the disks\u2019 edges and pulling them up, he was able to achieve a three-dimensional form. He combined the disks with a central stem layered with gold scrolls, bands of alternating pearls and silver teardrops, and pulled floriform silver shapes, which reinforced the feeling of motion.",

Even in an age of peripatetic artists, he was more widely traveled than most, living variously in Europe and America, and traveling to South America on three occasions.\r\n\r\n\tHeade moved in 1883 to Florida, where flourishing tropical flowers like magnolias both encouraged his interest in natural history and appealed to him artistically. He repeatedly painted magnolias, creating compositions that are infinitely varied and show evidence of various alterations that he made while painting. The subtle shifts within his work as a whole account in part for Heade\u2019s appeal to modern sensibilities. Although Heade's work received only limited artistic acclaim during his lifetime, his paintings were \u201crediscovered\u201d in the 1940s, and he has since evolved into an undisputed modern American master.",

Here, David Smith offers a witty interpretation of the unlikely act of lovemaking between a bird and a woman.\r\n\r\n\tThough Smith was not the first sculptor to use steel, no other artist has devoted his career to the medium with such brilliance and mastery. He learned the technique of welding steel from working in a car factory, and he applied this skill to the art of sculpture, forging his first steel work in 1933. Steel offered unique qualities for Smith, as he explained:  \"What it can do in arriving at form economically, no other material can do. The metal itself possesses little art history. What associations it possesses are of this century: power, structure, movement, progress, suspension, destruction, brutality.\"\r\n\r\n\tLeda is one of Smith\u2019s more poetic early steel constructions. The image of the swan is suggested by the graceful arcing neck and wing of the piece, while the theme of rape is conveyed by the diagonal thrust of one element piercing another. Myths and historical associations remained of central importance to Smith throughout his career, and many of his later works incorporate a balance between subject matter and radical abstraction.",

The subject is dressed in an exquisitely detailed skirt, with diamond patterning throughout and tassels that give the sense of movement as she runs. Part contemplative mood, as suggested in the graceful and noble turn of her head, and part high drama (she flees from cultures in conquest), this sculpture projects a poignant and romantic image of a so-called vanishing culture shortly before the Indian Wars ended native self-autonomy.\r\n\r\n\tOf note is that Powers accomplished this effect from his vantage point of Florence, Italy, using an Italian woman as a model and creating a fantastical costume that never existed in any Native American culture (except for the Ohio moccasins she wears that apparently formed a part of Powers\u2019s studio collection). This potent combination of fantasy, romance, and morality often permeates art of the Victorian era.",

The piercing gaze and the taut, sinewy hands of the aging subject carry the emotional weight of the painting and testify to Eakins\u2019s life-long commitment to portraying the human condition in all its heroism and frailty.\r\n\r\n\tCommissioned from Eakins by the Fidelity Trust Company for $700, this portrait of Fidelity\u2019s president, John B. Gest, has little to do with what one might think of as corporate portraiture: bland, formulaic images of seated, appropriately attired men intended to portray serious-minded, upstanding members of the community. Indeed, Gest performed the role to a T, serving as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia, in addition to fulfilling his duties at the financial company he served. However, by turning Gest\u2019s gaze away from the viewer, Eakins turns any possible engagement with the sitter into a study and an observation of the visible effects of old age. This portrait reveals the artist\u2019s intense devotion to realism through its truthful accuracy and penetrating portrayal of the subject's character.",

The central motif here may suggest a torso or flexed arm; notice the graceful modulations of form and color surrounding the contorted \u201cknot\u201d at the center.\r\n\r\n\tAt the age of 19, Macdonald-Wright left his home in Southern California for Paris. He remained overseas for six years, enrolling in a succession of art schools and committing himself to studying and assimilating the most advanced art of his time. In 1911 he met Russell, a fellow American, and they pioneered Synchromism as the only avant-garde movement in Europe established by Americans in the years before World War I. The war forced Macdonald-Wright to return to the United States, where he ultimately settled in Southern California and became a tireless advocate of Modernism.\r\n\r\n\tMacdonald-Wright was convinced that color and sound were equivalent phenomena and that one could orchestrate the colors of a painting the way a composer arranges notes and chords in music. Here, he uses such \u201cchords\u201d of complementary colors as a means of organizing the seemingly abstract composition. Yet, Arm Organization is not entirely abstract, and the potential forms of the curving torso, shoulder, and flexed arm likely derive from Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture Dying Captive, which the artist studied at the Musée du Louvre in Paris.",

Over the course of his 50-year career, he challenged historical attitudes about the nature of clay and revolutionized aesthetics. During the mid-20th century, he established California as the center for avant-garde ceramic art in America.\r\n\r\n\tVoulkos created his breakthrough ceramics in Los Angeles from 1954 to 1959. In addition to making and breaking the structure of pots, he created monumental sculptures that were, in essence, a combination of thrown and slab-built elements assembled into towering, expressionistic constructions. From about 1968 to 1978, Voulkos made a series of large-scale vases, such as this Vase/Stack, that emerged from the sculptures of the 1950s. Their totemic structures were created from a set of controlled, wheel-thrown cylinders that were stacked on top of each other. Voulkos employed a series of tools and techniques to alter the surfaces of these works. They included plunging knives into the surface and cutting ragged lines; adding small balls of clay into cut interstices; pressing holes into the vessel with his thumbs (called pass-throughs); and otherwise tearing and patching the clay. As this example shows, his strategic interventions articulated rather than obliterated the vessel form, liberating it from the weight of history and changing its aesthetic.",

      "about" : "Ed Ruscha\u2019s landmark images of American culture incorporate graphic elements ubiquitous to the commercial realm. An innovator in the 1950s of the West Coast Pop movement, Ruscha transitioned away from the Pop Art sensibility in the 1960s and soon directed his focus to a more conceptual point of view as he began to explore the ways in which text and images influence meaning and interpretation.\r\n\r\n\tIn his Untitled (#1) and Untitled (#2) diptych, Ruscha exuberantly depicts the American sublime while subtly distorting such popular imagery with his use of text. On the left panel, Ruscha paints a crisp and monumental mountain peak with the letters \u201cCO.\u201d sprawled across its terrain; the image takes on an almost brochure-like quality as it welcomes tourists to take part in the rustic grandeur, presumably of Colorado. The right panel, however, offers an adverse scene, as an austere rooftop amputates the mountain peak and text, disturbing the serene landscape. Now the image appears congested, and the \u201cCO.\u201d alludes to Company in the commercial sense. With his jarring juxtapositions, Ruscha poignantly conveys the harm of modern industry\u2019s appropriation of nature and satirizes the nation\u2019s overconsumption.",

      "nationality" : "American",
      "about" : "At age 88, when most artists would be well into retirement, Beatrice Wood embarked on a new body of work aesthetically different from her earlier ceramics. Critically lauded as innovative and expressive, the new work almost eclipsed her past objects. The signature pots from this period are a series of complex, often large-scale chalices. Assembled from thrown and hand-built forms, the chalices are totemic, sculptural compositions that demonstrate true harmony between form and glaze.\r\n\r\n\tWood\u2019s interest in ceramics was initially stirred by the purchase of six Dutch lusterware plates in 1933. Eager for a matching teapot, she enrolled in a ceramics class. After establishing her own studio, Wood created forms that were the result of free exploration, with experimental glazes. For the next 40 years, she made thrown and hand-built vessels and figures in a range of colors and textures. At once vivid and subtle, her glazes had depth and tonal richness and seemed to be molded with light. This spectrum was achieved through her all-over, in-glaze luster that, when fired, caused metallic salts to rise to the surface, a complex process almost impossible to control. Wood\u2019s metallic sheens were unlike any glaze being used by modern potters.",

In both form and glaze, his works boldly demonstrate a command of material that has been honed by years of experimentation. Since early in his career, DeVore's palette has consisted of flesh tones, ranging from blush to bone. The surfaces of his vessels often feature a delicate craquelure pattern that is created by painstakingly layering coats of glaze. Because of the varied techniques he uses to administer the glazes, DeVore\u2019s pieces unfold in layers as they are continually explored.\r\n\r\n\tThis vessel\u2019s undulating rim and graceful curves are reminiscent of Constantin Brancusi\u2019s work as well as the marble sculpture of ancient Italy and Greece. During this early period, DeVore focused on the torso form. The anthropomorphic lines of this vessel clearly delineate the human anatomy and allow for a greater sense of intimacy between the viewer and the vessel.",

In particular, he often interprets and critiques social and cultural conventions though his ceramic forms. The artist's vessels combine various techniques, clay bodies, historical styles, and recognizable decorative elements into witty and sometimes subversive works.\r\n\r\n\tSaxe\u2019s vessels can often be ornate and are always sculptural in form. Parisienne Chainsaw Massacre features gold luster and deep-hued porcelain glazes. The main body is in the form of a torso, a shape that Saxe used to great effect in monumental sculptures from the early 1980s. In addition to the chainsaw bands, the work is topped by an antelope finial. Saxe views the antelope as a symbol of nature's energy. His use of animal forms dates to the 1970s when he studied animals at the Los Angeles Zoo in conjunction with his coursework at school and his subsequent interest in 18th-century metalwork and trophies.",

      "about" : "Houston artists Dan Havel and Dean Ruck have collaborated on a number of site-specific interventions in the domestic architecture of Houston. However, these projects have been ephemeral: preserved only in drawings, models, and photographs. Trespass is the first monumental work by Havel Ruck Projects that is not short-lived.\r\n\r\n\tCreated out of materials scavenged at a building site in Houston\u2019s historic Magnolia Grove district, Trespass is constructed from the fragments of a 19th-century wooden bungalow, the kind of structure once typical of the district. At a glance, the sculpture is a seeming whirlwind of flotsam and jetsam. Closer examination, however, reveals the careful structure that holds together this maelstrom of slats. Trespass can be compared to the \u201canarchitecture\u201d projects of Gordon Matta-Clark. Like Matta-Clark, Havel and Ruck are interested in the social dimension of architecture, and as the title suggests, Trespass raises questions regarding property and community. Should the artists be considered trespassers for scavenging the materials from a building site? Or are the developers who are transforming a neighborhood the trespassers?",

As Hancock\u2019s mythology has developed and looped back and forth, the story has become complex and difficult to describe in a linear way. The underlying concept is one of equations: good and evil vs. black and white; the benevolent wholesome Mounds, with their pink moundmeat, vs. the evil mutant Vegans.\r\n\r\n\tBeacon depicts a miracle machine\u2014a mound made from vegan parts that enables Vegans to see in full color\u2014constructed by Sesom (Moses spelled backward), the minister and patriarch of the skeletal Vegans. Beacon is a tool to convert the unconverted. For Hancock, the optical plentitude is ultimately a means of regaining humanity.\r\n\r\n\tHancock's earlier work consisted of paintings on loose canvas and felt. Beacon, one of his first stretched canvases, is a kaleidoscopic tour de force. The precision of the central figure weighs against the unrestrained back- ground of collaged black-and-white splinters. Here, Hancock's mythological network offers a renewed source for painterly innovation.\r\n\r\n\t<span style=\"display: none\"> <\/span>",

      "about" : "Los Angeles-based artist Daniel Joseph Martinez produces provocative work deployed in the public realm through site-specific and public art projects investigating and challenging uneven power relationships in American society. Rooted in the art and activism of the Chicano art movement, Martinez contemplates his own mortality in relation to long-held intellectual and philosophical beliefs about the function of art as a vehicle for social change.\r\n\r\n\tThe hyper-realistic installation To Make a Blind Man Murder for the Things He's Seen (Happiness Is Over-rated) consists of a life-size animatronics replica of the artist dressed in a blue, industrial uniform that visually codifies the working-class individual in contemporary American society. Kneeling on the floor and holding a straight-edge razor blade in each hand, the figure proceeds to slash his wrists, while simultaneously emitting the artists\u2019 own sardonic, infectious laugh. Happiness Is Over-rated uses mordant humor as a means of examining conditions of life and death from the perspective of a U.S.-Latino artist, while making reference to Walt Disney, Yukio Mishima, and the globalization of identity politics.",

      "about" : "A monument to early Modernism, Paul Strand's Ceramic and Fruit demonstrates an abandonment of Pictorialism, characterized by a romantic and painterly style, in favor of carefully rendered Abstraction.\r\n\t\r\n\tAfter studying with photographer and social reformer Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture School in New York, Strand traveled throughout Europe. Upon his return to the United States, Strand compiled a portfolio that garnered the 26-year-old a one-man show with photographer and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz. Strand's work was of particular and timely interest to Stieglitz, who had been seeking photographic divergence from the then-dominant style, Pictorialism. Stieglitz sought images that could keep pace with the 20th-century experience, and Strand's work fit the bill.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the summer of 1916, Strand produced a series of compositional studies that pushed the medium of photography into artistic terrain that had been considered too complex to master with a camera. Influenced by the work of Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, and other Cubist artists, Strand worked closely with still lifes, removing subjects from their normal surroundings and shaping novel approaches to perspective and composition.\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Strand in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.\r\n\r\n\t    \r\n\tThrough confronting issues of space, dimensionality, and perspective, Strand's photographic still lifes, along with modern views of the city by Stieglitz and other photographers, created a brand-new Modernist aesthetic within photography. Strand employed what he called \"straight photographic methods\" to \"clearly see the limitations and at the same time the potential qualities of his medium.\" This balance became the essence of the 20th-century American Modernist movement. Strand's early still lifes are richly printed and exceptionally rare\u2014he made 14 in total, and only one print of Ceramic and Fruit. Strand's innovative approach to still life is an important testament to modern art.",

      "about" : "In his early career, Edward Steichen firmly believed that for photography to be recognized as a serious art form, the formal qualities of the image must resemble painting. For this reason, he chose to downplay the recording function of a camera, minimizing the details of the scene in favor of a more painterly style. Here, two black trees frame a luminous chestnut tree covered with flowers that appear as though they are dabs of paint.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe primary impetus of the earliest photography was documenting people, places, and events. Steichen's early work demonstrates a departure, to a type of photography in which the maker's personal, pictorial style is paramount. Created in a Romantic vein, this 1905 photograph of trees is more about light and the mood of the setting than faithful representation.\r\n\t \r\n\tSteichen was an important figure in American art history not only as a photographer but also as an advocate for American art, discovering and fostering artistic talent. With photographer Alfred Stieglitz, Steichen opened an art gallery in New York City. Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, more famously known as 291, introduced major European Modernists such as Paul Cèzanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso to American artists. Steichen's later style evolved from the vaguely defined details and textures of Trees, Long Island to exploring modes of Modernism within photography by capturing exacting details, a full range of tonal values, and convincingly solid forms.\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Steichen in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Eugene Smith recovered from the injuries he sustained while producing powerful World War II reportage in the South Pacific, he rejoined Life magazine, which had been founded in 1936 to publish photo essays taken with a \"mind-guided camera.\" With his Country Doctor series, Smith stretched the dimensions of the photo essay by adding an interpretive dimension to the traditional narrative content. The photographs not only documented what the doctor did, but also explored the emotional dimension of the physician's profession.\r\n\t\r\n\tAn advocate for moral responsibility in journalism, Smith sought to awaken the conscience of viewers through his photographs. By carefully selecting his subjects and then spending substantial periods of time with them to get a more intimate perspective on their lives, he created in-depth essays that evoke viewer sympathy. This process revolutionized the new field of photojournalism by expanding the scope of what a photo essay could be. Although Smith created several other seminal essays for Life, he felt that the photo essay should be largely managed by the photographer, a view that created friction with editors who were more text-oriented. He ultimately resigned and worked as an independent artist to further his causes.\r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Smith in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Notable within the composition is the hand-held remote shutter control\u2014Ahuja begins a work by taking studio photos of herself with such an apparatus.

The image of the sentinel, or watcher, was a theme that fascinated Smith. He made his first Sentinel sculpture in 1956, and by the end of that decade he had created five works in the first series. In 1961 he produced four additional Sentinel sculptures, all of which are characterized by flat planes of highly burnished stainless steel. With these works Smith stripped away the volumetric qualities of sculpture and instead presented the figure as an aggressively two-dimensional presence in space. The first of the 1961 series, Two Circle Sentinel is the closest to human scale of those four. The open circle can be read as an eye, and the lower disc evokes the curve of a classic hip-shot pose. Additional elements welded to the main body of the figure capture light and shadow.",

As the editors of U.S. Camera Magazine wrote, \"In that moment, Rosenthal's camera recorded the soul of a nation.\"\r\n\t \r\n\tAfter hearing that the initial flag raised was going to be replaced with a larger one, Rosenthal chose to follow the second team to the top of Mount Suribachi volcano to cover the event. Using a 4x5 field camera and not entirely ready for the initial jerk of the flagpole upward, he took a frame from his hip, anyway. The shot he thought he had missed became an American icon before he had ever seen the resulting image. Rosenthal's photograph of the flag being raised would soon grace the cover of almost every major newspaper, helping to lift human spirits in a time of war.\r\n\t \r\n\tOld Glory Goes Up on Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima won the Pulitzer Prize and was immortalized in the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. It has been the subject of poems, stamps, tattoos, and a major motion picture; has been reenacted at homecomings; has been re-created in Lego bricks; and has been interpreted as yard art.

In the early 1980s, he became fascinated by the pottery of the Yixing kilns in China. Potters in Yixing (in the Yangzi River delta area) used naturally colored stoneware clays to carve, sculpt, and slip-cast vessels. Notkin was intrigued by the exacting detail. He began to use it in a series of teapots that combine the traditions of Chinese Yixing pottery with the artist\u2019s social consciousness.\r\n\r\n\tNotokin's Yixing teapots are small in scale but loaded with potent messages that are often critical of humanity\u2019s failings. The artist frequently uses the human skull as a symbol of death as well as of human intellect. In the Cube Skull Teapot series, he combines the skull with imagery that explores the causes and effects of war.\r\n\r\n\tEver since his formative years as an artist in the California Funk movement of the 1970s, Notkin has demanded that his ceramics be socially activist. Notkin displays Funk's low-brow, ironic, provocative, and anti-establishment philosophies in his use of populist and purposefully overt symbols to comment on topics from war to homelessness.",

Inside the barn, a young boy plays the fiddle while two white men listen. A black field hand stands apart from this scene, leaning against the barn door as he eavesdrops. His thoughtful smile and attentive gaze suggest musical knowledge and experience, a point reinforced by the similarity between the black man\u2019s curled left hand and the fiddler\u2019s grip around the violin. Though each figure may be enjoying the same music, the barn door separates them.\r\n\r\n\tThe Power of Music parallels the widespread belief in the North that free blacks were a part of society but apart from whites. Mount, an admitted slavery supporter, was no civil-rights defender. Interestingly, though, he shows the black field hand with great detail and sympathy, simultaneously promoting the segregation of races and the dignity of African Americans.\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

Exhibited in 1848, this image shows the moment when America\u2019s victory in the recent Mexican-American War was the most important news of the day.\r\n\r\n\tAlthough America\u2019s victory was to be the fulfillment of Manifest Destiny\u2014the concept that the United States was destined to spread its ideas and laws across all of North America\u2014the real issue that arose after the war was how to handle slavery in newly acquired American states such as Texas. Woodville suggests this by showing two black figures in the lower right-hand corner. A young African American girl stands in rags next to an older field hand (likely her father), both of whom eagerly listen for news of slavery\u2019s destiny. The father\u2019s face appears anxious yet hopeful, and his daughter\u2019s appearance evokes sympathy from the viewer.\r\n\r\n\tThese two figures, as well as the bonneted woman above them, stand outside of the shelter of the American Hotel\u2019s porch. This literal exclusion of these individuals from the porch\u2019s shelter is a metaphor for their exclusion from public and political life before the Civil War. \r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

Although it was meant to represent the democratic values of American politics, a closer look at the painting reveals not an equal democracy, but an unequal and unstable society.\r\n\r\n\tOn the left side of the painting, an African American man who is likely a slave pours an alcoholic drink for a jolly, inebriated man. The slave\u2019s presence contrasts the voting scene on the right hand side, reminding viewers that not all men hold the same rights. Enslaved and free blacks, along with women, did not have the right to vote at this time.\r\n\r\n\tAmerican political parties in the 1800s often advanced a racist agenda disguised in the language of freedom and democracy.\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

The Society for the Abolition of Slavery in England used this image as their society seal in the 1780s, and American abolitionists adopted it during the early 1800s.\r\n\r\n\tThe image of the kneeling male slave in chains was a popular and effective propaganda tool for anti-slavery activists. Hands chained, the slave seems to beg the reader: \u201cEven though I am not your color, am I not a human being and a brother in Christ?\u201d The poem seeks to prove that enslaved men, women, and children are Americans and thus citizens who do not deserve to be treated as pieces of property.\r\n\r\n\tThis image and poem questioned the legitimacy of slavery in America. Copies of this broadside were sold at the New York Anti-Slavery Office and by mail to spread anti-slavery sentiment throughout the northern United States. Throughout the early nineteenth century, abolitionists used propaganda such as Am I Not a Man and a Brother? to increase their supporters and argue for the end of slavery.\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

In this well-worn copy of Revere\u2019s The Bloody Massacre, Attucks cannot be identified. Did Revere intentionally de-emphasize Attucks\u2019s color, or was it a coincidence? What does the absence of Attucks\u2019s identity as African American mean?\r\n\r\n\tOnly in some copies of the engraving is Attucks visible in the left corner, shot dead with blood gushing from his wounds. His darker skin tone and curly black hair distinguish him from others, yet he is certainly not at the center of the action. As is the case with many other pieces of European art from the 1400s\u20131800s, the black person appears on the edge of an image.

The work was a vital part of the pre-Civil War South\u2019s economy, as shown by the success of Guadalupe Pottery where this piece was made.\r\n\r\n\tWhite slave owner John M. Wilson Jr., originally from North Carolina, established the Guadalupe Pottery Company in Guadalupe County, Texas, in 1857. The Southern-style kiln and ash glaze used on many Wilson pieces reflect pottery practices in Edgefield, South Carolina, where the potter who trained Wilson\u2019s slaves probably learned his craft.\r\n\r\n\tWilson\u2019s slaves seem to have worked mostly as field hands, developing their pottery skills when the plantation work allowed. Even though they did not work full-time as craftsmen, their ability to produce excellent pottery led to high demand. After slavery ended Wilson\u2019s most talented potters left to establish their own company, H. Wilson &amp; Co. Pottery. This company was the first known African American-owned business in Texas. Bayou Bend holds many pieces from this company run by newly freed slaves in Texas, <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/detail/h-wilson-co-/\" target=\"_blank\">also on view in this online collection<\/a>.\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

They employed fellow African Americans and welcomed them as customers, unlike many white business people.\r\n\t\r\n\tH. Wilson &amp; Co. supported the African American community in Guadalupe County, Texas, following the abolition of slavery. The freed slaves of John M. Wilson Jr. (see <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/detail/wilson-one-gallon-crock/\" target=\"_blank\">John M. Wilson Pottery<\/a> in this collection) founded the company in 1869. Led by the master potters Hyrum, James, and Wallace Wilson, the company produced beautiful and unique pieces of pottery.\r\n\r\n\tHowever, H. Wilson\u2019s potters did not just copy what they had made for Guadalupe Pottery Company. The black artisans created new forms, textures, and styles of pottery. For example, the H. Wilson &amp; Co. used a salt glaze rather than the ash glaze used by Guadalupe Pottery Company. The company\u2019s success shows that some African Americans prospered in the difficult years after the Civil War. The black craftsmen of H. Wilson &amp; Co. were leaders of and advocates for African Americans in their small but vibrant Texas community.\r\n\r\n\tTo learn more, see<a href=\"http://texasartisans.mfah.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> the William J.

Greenfield Smith\u2014a free African American woman. Very few African American-made needlework pieces remain from the early 1800s. However, more than a dozen survive from young black women who, like Smith, attended the Oblate Sisters of Providence School in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\tBayou Bend is lucky to hold one of these samplers in its collection: a needlework completed by Smith around 1843. The Oblate Sisters, the first permanent Roman Catholic sisterhood created by and for African American women in the United States, taught their students skills that included needlework.\r\n\r\n\tIn the 19th century, elegant needlework was associated with accomplished, educated white women. By learning this skill, African American girls reflected their own respectability and refinement. Smith\u2019s needlework shows a family strolling along a pathway to a grand two-story home, a subject matter often used by white women in an earlier period. This sampler encourages us to think about how young African American women sought to define themselves according to white ideas of respectability or against those values.\r\n\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

Many wealthy Louisiana families owned plantations that produced sugar using slave labor.\r\n\r\n\tSugar was the most important crop of the New World. It drove the African slave trade and intensified African slavery throughout the Americas. Sugar cultivation was possibly the most intense form of slavery because of the speed and strength required to harvest and purify the sugar. For nearly 18 hours a day, slaves would cut and stack sugar cane. Slaves\u2019 lives on sugar plantations was difficult and demanding. This dish, with all its beauty, also serves as a reminder of the price of luxury paid in the sweat and blood of slaves.\r\n\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

      "about" : "Beaumont-born John Alexander has rooted his career in his native landscape, from his first paintings of the East Texas coast and Piney Woods to his later studies of the local landcape of New York's Long Island.\r\n\t\r\n\tMr. Friend's Revenge has the lush palette of a nocturnal swamp. The artist has revealed, however, that the painting was inspired by the sight of his cat, Mr. Friend, peering through a fish tank. The specter of the cat is repeated across the canvas, as are images of fish; an inverted death's head on the right indicates the cat's intent.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis work marks a turning point in Alexander's career. Even after he made his home in New York, leaving the cat behind with his ex-wife in Texas, Alexander frequently incorporated Mr. Friend in his art. In Mr. Friend's Revenge, Alexander blends Abstraction, Expressionism, and a brilliant eye for detail in a sweeping and energetic canvas.",

      "about" : "One of the most prominent and prolific American painters of the 20th century, Jacob Lawrence pioneered a Modernist pictorial style while retaining a personal commitment to the figurative. He launched his painting career in Social Realism, the result of his studies with the Works Progress Administration and the Harlem Art Workshop in the 1930s. In the two decades that followed, Lawrence produced a number of paintings that depict nightlife, of which The Brown Angel is exemplary.\r\n\t\r\n\tLawrence renders the interior of a bar with an intense compositional dynamism, bold patches of flattened color, and an overall sense of patterning. But these edgy, splintered forms also point to a larger feeling of social unease. The schematic figures and the fractured bar lend an air of tension and disquiet, one that relays the collective anxiety of the black community on the cusp of the Civil Rights Movement. In this scene, painted after the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, desegregation and its violent backlash loom overhead, much like the timekeeping brown angel who overlooks all.",

      "about" : "In 1959, while enrolled at the Art Students League of New York, Lee Bontecou began constructing abstract hybrids of painting and sculpture. To create these objects, Bontecou salvaged bits of industrial canvas. She would suture the canvas scraps together with wire, adhering them to an underlying structure of welded metal. The resulting wall reliefs grew progressively in size over the years. Eventually she incorporated found objects such as gas masks, helmets, bits of ragged metal, or a saw blade, as seen here.\r\n\t\r\n\tAn eerie topological abstraction, Untitled hangs on the wall, embodying the interest of Minimalist artists to overcome the division between painting and sculpture. The rough-hewn fabrics and their ocular shapes are organic, while the salvaged steel and saw blade suggest a violent, destructive, life-threatening force. The seemingly ruptured surfaces reveal mysterious inner spaces. At once mechanistic and sexual, abstract yet evocative of the brutal forces of war, Bontecou's works are both of their time and distinctly her own.",

During the summers of 1850 through 1852, he traveled and sketched in the Ohio River Valley, visiting the western North Carolina city of Asheville, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\r\n\t\r\n\tA View of Asheville, North Carolina depicts two figures looking out over the valley, one touching the shoulder of the other and motioning toward the town. The focal points of the work, however, are the dramatic mountain range in the background and the sky above, which displays the elegant transition from the golden glow of the sun at right to blue at center. Gnarled and blasted trees bracket the image, an allusion to the passage of time and America's primordial past. Juxtaposed against the cleared valley and developing city below, they warn about man's encroachment on and destruction of nature.",

      "about" : "Born a slave to American artist Charles Willson Peale, Moses Williams became a free man at the age of 27. Training in Peale\u2019s museum gave Williams many skills\u2014particularly in creating profile portraits using a machine known as the physiognotrace, which traced the outline of the sitter\u2019s head directly onto a sheet of white paper.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis silhouette shows a refined young lady, yet little else can be seen\u2014her race in particular is not clear from the outlines of her profile.\r\n\r\n\tAlthough the physiognotrace accurately represented a sitter\u2019s features, a silhouette can conceal as much as it can reveal. Williams would have known this as a portrait sitter himself. In 1803, Williams had his profile, now called Moses Williams, Cutter of Profiles (Library Company of Philadelphia), drawn by Raphaelle Peale. Williams likely wanted the more Anglicized or white aspects of his profile\u2014like his straight hair\u2014to be emphasized over his African features.\r\n\r\n\tAs a mixed-race individual who built a prosperous life in pre-Civil War Philadelphia, Williams took advantage of the ways a silhouette could obscure a sitter\u2019s profile. This form of portraiture does not fit neatly into either accommodation or resistance, showing instead the complex ways that African Americans responded to oppression.\r\n\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/art/collections/bayou-bend-african-american-material-culture/\">&lt; Back to Bayou Bend African American Material Culture: An Online Collection<\/a><\/strong>",

In precise, sharply delineated, geometric forms, the Precisionists championed the bridges, planes, towers, mills, and factories that made up America's new industrial landscape, as seen in this depiction of the latest form of transportation: the aeroplane.\r\n\t\r\n\tDriggs, the daughter of a steel-mill engineer, understood modern industry well. In 1928, en route to Ford Motor Company's celebrated Rouge factory plant in Detroit, she became fascinated with the Ford Tri-Motor plane in which she was flying and decided to depict the aircraft in a painting. She produced several sketches and completed Aeroplane upon her return to New York, where she exhibited the work in her first solo exhibition, at Daniel Gallery in 1929.\r\n\t\r\n\tIsolating the plane in the center of the composition, Driggs offers a specimen for the viewer to savor, a modern technological marvel. Using muted tones of gray, the artist defines the sleek metal materials of the plane. The tightly painted canvas is lined with various diagonals, creating an abstract, almost gridlike effect, which gives the plane a sense of dynamism and movement. Like other Precisionist paintings of the era, Aeroplane partakes of both realism and abstract design.",

Influenced by the èmigrè Surrealists who sought refuge in New York during World War II, Gottlieb explored a new abstract language, one loaded with mystical and mythological content.  \r\n\t\r\n\tIn the mid-1950s Gottlieb began to oppose closed and open forms, a motif that evolved into the famous Bursts that many view as the culmination of his career. Gottlieb reduced his composition to two essential components: a radiant red circle floating above a lively maze of large black brushstrokes. The rival forms one serene and heavenly, the other turbulent and expressive have been seen to represent essential pairs such as order and chaos, female and male, or heaven and earth. Charged with emotional resonance, Penumbra shows Gottlieb at the height of his powers.",

Biggers arrived in Houston in 1949 to head the art department at the newly opened Texas Southern University. Embracing mural painting as a means of expressing his heritage, he became the region´s most eloquent chronicler of the changing identity of African Americans. In 1957 Biggers was a pioneer in traveling to Africa to learn more about his cultural roots. Out of his experiences he developed a unique synthesis of African, European, and American art that influenced numerous younger artists.",

Soon, Castle would incorporate lamination techniques to achieve what he called a more expressive, ahistorical, and organic approach to furniture. This development was inspired, in part, by his friendship with British furniture maker John Makepeace, who had revived traditional cabinetmaking skills and paired them with a contemporary aesthetic.\r\n\t\r\n\tUltimately, Castle developed his own sculptural language that he\r\n\thas employed to great effect in wood, fiberglass, metal, and plastic.\r\n\tHe continues to create innovative, dynamic furniture, including 2007's\r\n\tDem Bones, also in the MFAH collection of decorative arts.",

Morris\u2019s Rhytons almost always appear as horned animals resembling quadrupeds such as horses, bulls, or stags and are often paired with large rounded stone or pouch-like forms. Many, as seen here, carry vessels or other accoutrements on their backs. This Rhyton Vessel demonstrates Morris\u2019s remarkable skill in capturing the essence of an animal\u2019s spiritual power.

      "about" : "The designs by Danish silversmith Erik Magnussen for Gorham Manufacturing Company have long been recognized as some of the most elegant and accomplished metalwork objects made in America during the Art Deco period. His work is of the utmost quality in both craftsmanship and design, and his forms clearly evoke the many influences of American Art Deco in their shape, ornament, and style. Magnussen trained as a silversmith in Denmark and was part of the same circle of craftsmen as Georg Jensen. Magnussen was hired by Gorham in 1925 to produce silver in the new modern styles. For the next four years, Magnussen created designs that reflected the influence of the Art Deco style, the American city, and his own classical Danish heritage.\r\n\r\n\tThis centerpiece is particularly noteworthy for its size, elegant lines and proportion, luxuriousness of materials, and modern styling. As seen here, Magnussen often incorporated ivory, semiprecious stones, or exotic woods into his designs.",

      "about" : "Celebrated Israeli architect and designer Ron Arad is renowned for furniture that incorporates industrial materials with a language of volume and sinuous line. His Narrow Paparadelle chair exhibits extraordinary freedom in its design, seeming to be continually in motion.  \r\n\t\r\n\tSince the beginning of his career, Arad has designed his furniture using steel, a material attractive to him for its surface, minimalist spirit, strength, and ability to be contorted by pressure or fire. All of his early furniture was created by hand; he purposefully avoided the effects of machine tooling.\r\n\t\r\n\tInfluenced by artists and architects ranging from Marcel Duchamp and the Surrealists to Marcel Breuer, Jean Prouvé, and the group Archigram, Arad first rose to prominence in the early 1980s. When he began serial production of his furniture later in the decade, he introduced controlled manufacturing flaws so that each chair would be subtly different.\r\n\t\r\n\tBy 1992, Arad introduced woven steel wire to his designs, allowing him to create undulating forms that were more fluid. Narrow Paparadelle chair, a version of his earlier London Paparadelle, is one of these works. The design emphasizes the flexible nature of the material through its soft, rolling curves, similar to the pasta noodle pappardelle. The curves are reinforced at the edges by steel, which gives the form enough strength to be functional.",

In the early years, Henningsen developed scientific studies and theories concerning the quality of light that would greatly influence his designs. One of his most famous, the PH \"Artichoke\" Lamp, became immediately popular, gracing the lobby spaces of public buildings in Denmark as well as the interiors of private homes and businesses, as it still does today.\r\n\r\n\tHenningsen\u2019s theories center on the ideas that light must not blind; there must be soft transitions between the lighted and shaded areas of a lighting fixture; designs must correct the color of light; and designs must achieve good shadows. By 1958, when he designed the PH \"Artichoke\" Lamp for the Langeline Pavilion Restaurant in Copenhagen, he had perfected his goal of achieving harmony in light. The lamp's graduated tiers of copper and enameled metal shades wrap around a central light core. They emit a warm glow, thereby changing the nature and softening the volume of light.",

      "about" : "This untitled drawing is from a suite of nine sketchbook drawings that established Jackson Pollock as one of the great draftsmen of the 20th century. Based on style, the sketchbook dates to about 1946 or 1947, not long before Pollock\u2019s breakthrough into the dripped-and-poured style of his mature period.\r\n\r\n\tPollock did not possess a natural ability for representational drawing, but these images, created after Old Master paintings, reveal a brilliant grasp of compositional analysis. Collectively, they are a summation of Pollock\u2019s early influences, especially Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and the Surrealists. A visual declaration of independence, they reveal how Pollock not only absorbed the styles of these early European modernists but also forged ahead to create his own pictorial vocabulary.\r\n\r\n\tA Suite of Notebook Drawings introduces a new type of draftsmanship emphasizing the immediacy of the artist\u2019s gesture, a fundamental component of Pollock\u2019s aesthetic. As Pollock never made preparatory drawings for his paintings, these images stand as independent works and are often referred to by their catalogue raisonné numbers. Here, \"O'Connor-Thaw\" is a reference to Francis Valentine O\u2019Connor and Eugene Victor Thaw, who wrote the catalogue raisonné--the comprehensive catalogue of paintings, drawings, and other works--of Pollock\u2019s career. The energy with which these drawings pulsate also signals a new era in art history as the center of the art world shifted from Paris to New York City.",

The work reflects the collaboration of three individuals: the needlewoman, in all probability a member of the upper class who commissioned the frame; the chair maker; and the upholsterer who constructed the foundation and attached the embroidery. The latter would also make certain that the chair was fully stuffed to ensure its occupant the utmost comfort. On this example, one of only three known with stitched covers, the back is upholstered with an English stamped harrateen, a woolen fabric patterned with meandering bands, butterflies, and flowers.\r\n\t \r\n\tIn 18th-century America, upholstery work was the principal decorative arts-related profession in which women could earn a livelihood. The relatively undisturbed frame of this chair presents an extraordinary record of colonial upholstery which, in turn, contributes toward its significance in establishing historical accuracy in the documenting the upholstery of period furniture.",

The new, epic landscape they depicted functioned as a national symbol of grandeur and promise, yet at the same time it served as rumination on the subject of nature and the divinity to be found within it.\r\n\r\n\tBierstadt first left the East Coast to travel west in 1859, accompanying a government-sponsored trip from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains. Compiled from close observation, sketches, and stereoscopic views taken on the expedition, Indians Spear Fishing portrays the West as a pristine, sublime wilderness that seemingly could be found only in the Bible's Book of Genesis. Within a compressed space, Bierstadt draws together barren rock formations, towering waterfalls, spindly trees, crystalline water reflecting rocky outcrops, and a peak that pierces the wispy and moisture-laden clouds, turning to mist below. In the brightly lit foreground near the shore, a boat filled with three Native Americans provides scale and identifies the location as unmistakably that of the West; the boat laden with furs spells the riches of the land.",

In 1946, after several years in the Army Corps of Engineers, he suffered an emotional breakdown and began to experience frequent visions. He recorded them at first on a notepad by his bedside, then on canvas. These visions were often simple abstract forms or combinations of forms that appeared to Bess as symbols he called ideograms. Using small canvases and a limited palette, he documented these symbols of his unconscious without, as he claimed, any reinterpretation.\r\n\t \r\n\tThe clarity and simplicity of Untitled 11A, and the manner in which it was painted, belie the complexity of its significance for Bess.

By placing him next to a column in a relaxed pose, the portrait is carefully crafted to emphasize Houston\u2019s leadership qualities.  The camera´s capacity to document people, places, and events was the primary impetus for early photographers such as the Meade Brothers, who took this rare daguerreotype in 1851. In photography studios of this period, daguerreotype portraits were priced by plate size. This full-plate image is the only known existing full-length portrait of Houston, who stood 6 feet 2 inches tall. As the leader of the Texas Revolution and two-term president of the short-lived Republic of Texas, Houston was a knowledgeable frontiersman and liked to dress the part. However, this portrait shows him in more-conservative attire, probably to garner mass appeal for a presidential run.\r\nThe Meade Brothers established one of the most successful photography studios in America, capturing famous subjects including Kit Carson and Commodore Matthew Perry. This portrait was probably taken in the brothers' New York studio the year after its opening, in 1850. Growing competition between portrait studios at the time led them to offer diverse options. Here, a papier-mâché column demonstrates the trend toward incorporating props into portraiture.  This work is rare because it is a full-plate image of a recognized subject by a recognized studio. The lithograph of this photograph enabled the image to appear in publications, but the daguerreotype was long thought to be lost. Discovered in 1990, it was acquired by the MFAH shortly thereafter.",

Encouraging a favored fighter and reacting to and with the punches until the bout\u2019s end, the spectators are vicarious participants in the fight.

      "about" : "One of Frederic Remington\u2019s masterpieces, this painting depicts cowboys hiding in a waterhole, their source of survival in the arid desert and of protection from the pursuing Plains Indians. The manipulated perspective gives the scene a panoramic quality and introduces a large shadow to convey the idea of \u201cpassing\u201d\u2014the ever-present threat of death looming in the Western territories during the Indian Wars, as well as the passing of the West itself.\r\n\r\n\tAs an illustrator, painter, sculptor, and writer, Remington created a popular image of the American West as a heroic battleground for U.S. westward expansion. His knowledge of the West grew from his frequent trips there to make sketches, take photographs, and buy the artifacts of Native American cultures and Western frontier life. Back in his studio near New York City, he chronicled vanquished Native American cultures and created images that popularized the cowboy as a national folk hero.\r\n\r\n\tFight for the Waterhole was published in 1903 in Collier\u2019s Weekly as part of Remington's four-year contract with the magazine to reproduce one painting each month. This alliance encouraged Remington to experiment with his technique, and as seen here, the results included looser brushwork, refined compositions, a bolder palette, and the development of psychological qualities in his art.",

But in that year, he developed a glass-coloring technique that would seal his reputation as America´s greatest Art Nouveau designer. Called Favrile, a twist on an Old English word meaning handmade, it was created by exposing molten glass to metallic vapors. Rather than just sitting on the surface, the color was embedded in the glass itself giving it a beautiful, iridescent quality. Tiffany himself considered this peacock-feather vase to be an important example of his work.",

Why, he asks, do we believe that heaven is above and hell below? Like the man in this video, the viewer is also immersed in the artist\u2019s visual field. For Viola, water is both a vehicle and a site for altered consciousness and spiritual reawakening.",

Toylike animals; placid landscape scenes, mostly of the Delaware Water Gap; and renditions of Penn\u2019s treaty consistently populate Hicks\u2019s kingdoms\u2014so peaceable in their ideal of universal harmony, yet weighted with national and religious concerns of the time.

Surrounded by the rich veins of silver, she is said to have asked her husband if they could make a \u201cfine and memorable thing\u201d from it. The decision was reached then and there to have a silver service crafted by the best silversmith in the country. The pieces were heavily ornamented with references to Persian and Mughal, as well as Chinese and Japanese, designs. The bowls and tureens were covered with lotus flowers, cherry blossoms, and engraved Chinese dragons. The ice cream dish had elephant trunks as feet.",

This scene depicts Eustace, the patron saint of hunters, in 15th-century clothing and reveals Dürer\u2019s consummate skill in the representation of animals, plants, and landscape.\r\n\r\n\tAccording to legend, a Roman general named Placidus was hunting when Christ appeared to him as a white stag with a radiant crucifix between its antlers. This vision prompted Placidus to convert to Christianity, and he was baptized Eustace, which means \u201cfaithful\u201d in Greek. After he refused to make a pagan sacrifice, Emperor Hadrian condemned Eustace and Eustace's family to be roasted inside a bronze statue of a bull. Saint Eustace was particularly revered in the 15th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\n\tAs an artist for whom the close study of nature was paramount, Dürer employed the stag hunt in the forest as an opportunity to display his skills. An homage to Flemish landscape paintings, this engraving\u2019s composition was also influenced by Pisanello\u2019s painting The Vision of Saint Eustace. During Dürer\u2019s lifetime, the painting was in Verona and therefore on the artist\u2019s travel route when Dürer visited Italy in 1495 and 1496.",

Instead, he reveals the physical struggle of his painting process.\r\n\r\n\tOne of the major innovators of the 20th century, Matisse accorded color an unprecedented structural and expressive role in his compositions. In 1905 he helped launch the century's first avant-garde movement, Fauvism. (Confronted by the boldly colored paintings of Matisse and contemporaries at the 1905 Salon d'Automne in Paris, a critic claimed that the works could have been painted by fauves, or wild beasts.)\r\n\r\n\tMatisse moved away from the bright colors of Fauvism into new artistic terrain, and he painted Olga Merson two years after the movement\u2019s dissolution. He leaves traces of his effort as he works through the placement and rendering of his sitter: the scraping and over-painting of the face, neck, and forearm, and the bold black marks that so severely reaffirm the figure´s placement on the canvas. Yet he also conveys a powerful impression of Merson. She fills the frame, and the curved diagonals anchor her to the composition, creating a sense of monumentality.",

His etchings featuring idyllic landscapes, which were inspired by 17th-century Dutch landscape paintings and the forests of Dessau, were the source for German Romanticism. He produced 28 highly personal etchings in which giant vegetation dwarfs the human figures. This young couple, nude yet modest, is in Arcadia, a region in ancient Greece that symbolizes a pastoral paradise. The couple fix their gaze on the Latin inscription on a tomb translated by Kolbe as \u201cI too lived in Arcadia.\u201d This phrase is an example of memento mori, a cautionary reminder of the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death. Arcadian landscapes such as this one were immensely popular among German artists of the late 18th century.",

This drawing, from a set of five with identical composition, is on tracing paper, which was the artist's favorite support toward the end of his life. Compared with others from the series, it is only slightly finished. Degas uses heavy charcoal lines to emphasize the woman\u2019s unconscious, habitual movements. The undeveloped background consists of a large anthropomorphic object\u2014perhaps a towel or a servant\u2014and a basin to the right, above which appears a series of indistinct toiletries on a shelf. These pictures of mundane bathers are highly unconventional within their art-historical context. They participate in a genre of representation traditionally dominated by classicized and eroticized depictions of unclothed females.",

Though he never completely abandoned naturalistic representation, he was one of the pioneers in developing Abstract painting early in the 20th century. Kupka explored philosophically and scientifically the nature of color\u2014its unity and total effect on a work of art. Beginning with one color, Kupka played out its full scale and range, which for him translated into a work with a spiritual quality. \"Atmosphere in a painting is achieved through bathing the canvas in a single scale of colors,\" he said. \"Thus one achieves an état d'âme (state of being) exteriorized in luminous form.\"",

      "about" : "When Abstract Expressionism was at its height in the 1950s, Jasper Johns returned to concrete imagery. He painted simple icons: flags, numbers, and targets. In Ventriloquist, Johns arranges such imagery to create a symbolic self-portrait. In the mid-1980s, for the first time in his painting career, Johns launched a series of paintings based on objects that he had collected and images that he had created, pointing to his influences and artistic process. Ventriloquist is the most personal work of this series, one in which Johns drops his habitual reserve.\r\n\r\n\tAt first glance, the composition seems realistic, particularly the right half with its shaded nail, meticulously rendered wicker hamper, and detailed bathtub fixtures. However, the left half of the composition plays more freely with illusionism. Images of the eccentric pots of visionary ceramicist George Ohr float unanchored. A whale, based on Barry Moser\u2019s 1979 illustrations of Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, is embedded in the lines of the background. A stacked pair of American flags, one of the artist's most famous motifs, bridges the divide. However, rather than rendering them in the familiar red, white, and blue, Johns paints the central flags in their negative opposite tones. Similarly, the black-and-white image in the upper right corner is a careful, but reversed, copy of a Barnett Newman lithograph Johns admires. In Ventriloquist, Johns \u201cspeaks\u201d through these works of art and pictorial inversions. Like a ventriloquist projecting his voice through a dummy, he mobilizes an array of objects and images to address his place among the rich abundance of America\u2019s visual culture.",

In fact, Davis conceived of compositions such as this one in terms of the staccato pulse of American jazz.\r\n\r\n\tOver a career spanning more than half a century, Davis uniquely combined Cubist syntax with the ambience of American life, providing a bridge between the first generation of American Modernists and the later Abstract Expressionists. A student of Realist painter Robert Henri, Davis participated in the landmark 1913 Armory Show (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in New York and was inspired by the display of European avant-garde art. Davis\u2019s assimilation of Modernist techniques in general, and of Cubism in particular, was strongly colored by his avocation of Realism.\r\n\r\n\tHere, the flat, patterned forms reduce spatial relationships and contradict illusionism. At the same time, Davis maintains a real sense of the bustle and life of a busy harbor. Gloucester Harbor was executed during Davis\u2019s tenure in the Works Progress Administration program as a government-supported artist.

Ide Company remains his most famous.\r\n\t \r\n\tWith his fierce attention to tone, lighting, and composition, Outerbridge managed to elevate this advertisement for Ide shirt collars from a simple sales solicitation to a stylized still life. The crisp contrast of the curved form of the collar against the checkered tile presents the product with an elegance that speaks to both high fashion and art. The MFAH owns the only known 8\" x 10\" version of this image printed in gelatin silver, as well as this 4\" x 5\" version printed in platinum, as typically preferred by the artist.\r\n\r\n\tAfter studying at the Clarence H. White School of Photography in New York, Outerbridge began to publish his photographs in Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar magazines and to work in advertising. In the 1930s, Outerbridge become a pioneer of color photography using the carbro-color process, challenging the then-prevalent view that color photography was a purely commercial medium. \r\n\r\n\tTo view specific works by Outerbridge in the collection, contact the museum's <a href=\"http://www.mfah.org/research/make-appointment-works-paper-study-center/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#f15836\">Works on Paper Study Center<\/font><\/a> for an appointment.",

Over a career spanning more than five decades, he created a body of paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture that is without parallel. His early paintings charted African American folkways and history. Following a UNESCO-sponsored trip to Ghana, Togo, and the Republic of Benin in 1957, he created groundbreaking murals that introduced an Africa unfamiliar to most Americans. In the 1970s and 1980s, his compositions achieved a remarkable synthesis of personal experience and ancestral memory.\r\n\r\n\tThe Cradle is typical of the compassionate vision Biggers brought to his early work, expressing his sympathy for the downtrodden and poor. He returned to the image of the mother and child many times, always celebrating the love and strength of women in all walks of life.",

Together with her friend, and often rival, art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner, Sears served as a preeminent Boston tastemaker at the turn of the 20th century. In addition, Sears was an accomplished painter and photographer who exhibited her work in important international exhibitions such as the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago and the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\n\tIn this painting, Sears\u2019s satin dress exemplifies Sargent\u2019s extraordinary skill at rendering white, subtly nuanced with painterly flourishes of lavender, blue, and pink. The stunning surface display of paint connotes elegance and dash, and illustrates what made Sargent the portraitist of choice for the aristocracy of England and America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",

In 1951 he stated, \u201cOne might truthfully say that abstract art is stripped bare of other things in order to intensify it, its rhythms, spatial intervals, and color structure.

Turrell sought not to depict light but to use light itself as his material, and his earliest works investigated the effects of artificial light. He also developed a number of installations that heightened the relationship between light and the architectural frame.\r\n\r\n\tThe MFAH commissioned Turrell\u2019s The Light Inside for the underground tunnel linking the museum's Caroline Wiess Law Building with the Audrey Jones Beck Building when the latter opened in 2000. The Light Inside turns the walls of the tunnel into vessels for conducting light. An expanded version of his earlier explorations of light in his Shallow Space Construction series, Turrell\u2019s The Light Inside is an all-encompassing environment.\r\n\r\n\tTranscending the traditional confines of built spaces, The Light Inside acts as both a passage and a destination. The raised walkway guides visitors forward and gives them the sense of floating in space, while the changing cycle of illumination (which shifts from blue, to crimson, to magenta) further invites contemplation. The Light Inside makes the experience of moving between the Law and the Beck Buildings not only an exploration of light and space, but also a profound and awe-inspiring experience.",

To produce this work, Nadelman used cherry wood. He brushed the surface with gesso and then painted each figure, wiping and rubbing the wood in order to create an aged, roughened surface that resembles the American folk art sculptures he admired and collected.\r\n\r\n\tHere, an elegantly dressed gentleman in black tie guides his graceful partner through the steps of the tango, a Latin American dance craze that raged in Europe and the United States during and after World War I. Although the tango is well known for its seductive qualities, this one is danced by a buttoned-up pair who perform its steps far from the ports of Buenos Aires. Nadelman simplifies forms, refining the curves and counter-curves, the masses and counter-masses. This sculpture becomes a playful image of the couple suspended in motion, gliding toward each other. Indeed, Nadelman\u2019s skill resides in isolating the sexual energy of the dance and filling the empty spaces between the man and the woman, capturing the charged moment just before their hands clasp.",

His approach to the medium is born from an inquisitive rejection of conforming to societal pressures, resulting in raw and psychologically revealing photographs that often highlight the loneliness and isolation characteristic of postwar identity.\r\n\r\n\tAs the first European to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, Frank spent two years traveling by car throughout the United States, photographing his personal\u2014and often cynical\u2014reactions to the country. The culmination of this expedition was the 1959 publication of his seminal book The Americans. As Beat Generation novelist Jack Kerouac explained in the introduction, Frank \u201csucked a sad poem right out of America onto film.\u201d\r\n\r\n\tFrank presented an unromanticized portrait of a nation that was rapidly changing. He recognized various aspects of American life and society, in particular the \u201ccar culture\u201d evolving around a new system of interstate highways. This photograph of a streetcar in New Orleans reveals social tensions rooted in the South in the mid-1950s, expressed by the hierarchical placement of whites, blacks, men, women, and children. Trolley, New Orleans was used as the cover for several early editions of The Americans, demonstrating the significance of this image to Frank.\r\n\r\n\tThe MFAH owns more than 320 of Frank's photographs, including all of the images from The Americans. He later added filmmaking to his body of work and made his first film, Pull My Daisy, with painter Alfred Leslie. It was added to the National Film Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress in 1996. The MFAH has served as distributor and repository for Frank's film and video since 1986.

Deeply concerned about the political and economic turbulence of his time, Cole filled his landscapes with symbols and warnings, capturing a resplendent America that was ultimately fraught with moral and national urgency.\r\n\r\n\tScholars have long proclaimed Cole the \u201cfather\u201d of the first native school of American painting. Dubbed the Hudson River School, the movement is perhaps more accurately described as the American branch of 19th-century Romantic landscape painting. A British-born American transplant, Cole created a distinct niche for American scenery by isolating its constituent parts: majestic mountains, brilliant skies, abundant wilderness, flowing rivers, and flaming autumn trees, all of which he celebrates in Indian Pass.\r\n\r\n\tIn this classic Hudson River School landscape, sunlight illuminates a glorious wilderness scene, filled with fallen branches, lichen-covered woods, and framing trees that give way to a towering mountain that pierces passing clouds. In the foreground, blasted trees suggest the inevitable passage of time while the Native American figure, bow in hand, introduces a nostalgic element; by 1847, when this work was painted, Native Americans no longer inhabited the scenic wilderness Cole depicts. By combining these elements with a lush, dramatic setting, Cole offered 19th-century viewers a marker by which to measure the nation\u2019s past, present, and future.",

The formal and spatial tension of the arching lines is emphasized by the cropping of the frame, a compositional device shared with photographers such as Alfred Stieglitz.\r\n\r\n\tO\u2019Keeffe has become one of the most famous American artists, and her rise to fame was due in large part to her connection with the German-trained Stieglitz. Renowned in his own right as an artist, Stieglitz actively promoted European modernist ideals and encouraged young American artists to experiment with the new formalist language, giving them a venue to show their work at his legendary 291 gallery in New York. When he and O\u2019Keeffe met in 1916, Stieglitz had established himself as a staunch supporter of the avant-garde, exhibiting the work of European, as well as American, artists.\r\n\r\n\tAt Stieglitz\u2019s gallery, O\u2019Keeffe saw the work of European innovators such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. That influence\u2014along with the aesthetic theories of American artist and educator Arthur Wesley Dow\u2014greatly inspired her own paintings.

In other words, Peale seems to beg the viewer to consider issues of illusion and reality, and the artist\u2019s magical ability to transform mere pigment (as suggested by the blobs of paint revealed to the viewer on the palette, carefully juxtaposed with the painted canvas) into life (as revealed by the vibrantly alive portrait of his wife on the easel). Such investigations into painting as more than a mimetic enterprise are characteristic of the artist\u2019s most sophisticated works.",

A tall, shoulderless figure, he wears clothing made from rows of eagle feathers. He has large, prominent eyes, a green face, and horns.\r\n\r\n\tKachinas are supernatural beings who embody the spirits of living things, inanimate objects, and ancestors who have become a part of nature. They can be male or female, and they represent aspects of the natural world: clouds, animals, plants, human qualities, and even death.\r\n\r\n\tNative Americans of the Southwest United States believe that kachinas come to live amongst them from late December until July. During this time, ceremonies take place in which men of the pueblo dress and perform dances as incarnations of the spirits. \r\n\r\n\tKachina \"dolls\" are not playthings. They are carved-and-painted figures that represent the kachinas. The men give them to women and children. The dolls are hung in homes, where they bring blessings upon the household and teach children about the different spirits. Carved from cottonwood or pine, kachina dolls play an important role in the Hopi and Zuni religions.",

A highly regarded center for Southwest American pottery, San Ildefonso is known for its painted figures and contrasting matte-on-polished surfaces.\r\n\t\r\n\tMaria molded pots, and Julian painted the decorations. Working with archaeologists studying ancient pottery, the Martinezes were inspired to revive and revitalize traditional motifs. Julian developed a clay-based paint that remains matte (flat) when fired in a kiln, and as a result he was able to re-create the technique known as black-on-black pottery. The contrast of highly polished and flat surfaces gives this pottery dramatic impact. Julian rarely repeated decorative motifs except for his famous avanyu.",

      "about" : "Having grown up against a backdrop of alcoholism and a country-club culture obsessed with image over content, artist Eric Fischl focuses on the rift between experience and expression. His landmark portfolio Year of the Drowned Dog consists of two three-part components. When combined, they operate as a pictorial game.\r\n\r\n\tThe first component is a triptych of a beach panorama, and the second consists of three separate smaller sheets (mother and child, three sailors, walking man) that overlap the panorama. These irregular-shaped segments transform a tranquil Caribbean beach scene into a complex narrative. The mother and child observe the boy and the dog of the title; the other figures do not interact with each other. Each of the sheets\u2019 varying times of day, as evidenced by the figures\u2019 shadows, underscores the independent, nonlinear development of the imagery. Year of the Drowned Dog was Fischl\u2019s first attempt at a complex, multi-component project of etchings. It marks a shift in subject matter as he began to explore the negative impact of American tourism on idyllic beaches of islands that had recently been developed by the resort industry.",

Hummingbirds were related to agricultural fertility because they drink flower nectar and spread pollen. Their bright plumage was associated with rainbows.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the late 19th century, the Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico reached the height of artistry in its pottery making. Zuni vessels were decorated with rhythmical repetition of geometric designs, expressed with lines rather than solid painting. The outlines were often filled with hatching, a pattern of parallel or crossed lines. Sacred figural images were typically used on jars consecrated for religious ceremonies and kept in buildings called kivas.  Tourist demand for these kiva jars led to the creation of vessels like this one, decorated with religious symbols but not blessed or used ritually.\r\n\t\r\n\tA ceremonial break\u2014a short interruption of the lines that separate the neck from the rest of the vessel\u2014is a characteristic of Zuni pottery. A Zuni legend warned that a potter would die if the line were not broken. The break also prevented the potter's spirit from being trapped in the vessel.",

      "about" : "Painted views of towns and landscapes were enormously popular in the 18th century. Travelers to Italy eagerly sought accurate and detailed records of their visits to Rome, Florence, Venice, and Naples. Canaletto was the most famous painter of vedute (Italian for \"views\") at the time. His ability to capture the light, life, buildings, and expanse of Venice established his reputation as one of the greatest topographical painters of all time.\r\n\r\n\tCanaletto was the son of Bernardo Canal, a painter of theater sets, with whom he worked and from whom he presumably learned the rules of perspective, so important for Canaletto's compositions. In 1719 Canaletto went to Rome, where he may have become familiar with the paintings of Giovanni Panini, an artist known for his Roman cityscapes and imaginary topographical views using actual landmarks as motifs. A year later Canaletto was back in Venice, attracting an international clientele, especially wealthy English patrons. This association, and the effects of the War of Austrian Succession, which greatly reduced the number of visitors to Venice, prompted Canaletto to travel to England, where he resided from 1746 until 1755. Canaletto\u2019s works can be grouped into two major categories: topographic views depicting with extreme precision particular aspects of Venice and other European cities; and capricci, or imaginary views, in which architectural monuments have been displaced and rearranged according to the painter\u2019s fancy. The Entrance to the Grand Canal, Venice, with the church of Santa Maria della Salute on the left, belongs in the first category. \r\n\r\n\tDespite the self-defined limits of his subject matter, Canaletto was an extraordinarily brilliant artist who delicately enhanced his subject by carefully omitting selected details in order to focus on an essential image. His fine colors subtly combine all the hues associated with the real Venice as much as with the idea, or memory, of the city. Executed in his studio after studies from the motif, his paintings are, therefore, more than topographic records. They are pure, intellectual re-creations.",

His canvases were in high demand by both European and American collectors, and his fame has been rekindled of late.\r\n\r\n\tExecuted with extraordinary painterly skill, The Elder Sister is a sentimental scene for which the artist's daughter Henriette and son Paul served as models. Bouguereau has stripped them of all imperfections, portraying them as children with perfect features, dressed in clean garments, and posed against an idyllic rural background. The composition is unified and balanced, with the children\u2019s arms and legs converging nearly at the center of the canvas. Bouguereau\u2019s smooth paint application and diligent attention to detail result in an almost hyperrealistic representation. Although his works were originally inspired by classicism and antique idealism as transmitted through the works of the masters of the High Renaissance, images like this one present an emphatically Victorian ideal.",

He was among the first English furniture makers to be educated in design, having studied at St. Martin's Lane Academy, founded by painter William Hogarth. Linnell worked closely with the premier architect of the day, Robert Adam, and Linnell's close competitor in the trade was Thomas Chippendale.",

One senses the speed and vigor with which Van Gogh transcribed this scene to canvas, capturing the wild, almost electric presence of the site. The artist\u2019s manic marking, combined with his broad exploitation of greens, blues, and yellows, makes for an exceeding lively image. The composition\u2014strong and simplified, with the rocks stepping their way back to the craggy tree\u2014grounds the potential chaos of colors and marks. Theo van Gogh, the artist\u2019s brother, was so taken by this painting that he immediately framed it and hung it beside The Sower, one of Vincent\u2019s undisputed masterpieces.",
